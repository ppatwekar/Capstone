{"What is the main legal issue in Case 22-1178 between the FBI and Yonas Fikre?": " to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact that the government for a period of five years put him on the No Fly List.And so the Court, this Court or another, lower courts, can order the government to not use his past No Fly List status for any particular purpose. Annotate the records, that's something that the government has been ordered to do by a court in -- after the only No Fly List trial in this nation's exists.And so, here, Mr. Fikre has an interest in the government not returning to its old ways, and so it maintains the interest in the injunction. But there's even more concrete things. The government, by standing by its prior decision, indicates an interest in continuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that the government is likely to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact thatJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre. Mr. Joshi.\nSopan Joshi: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's No Fly List claims are moot.He's not on the list.He hasn't been on the list in eight years.And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently and, here, what -- what underscores Your Honor's point is that Yonas Fikre doesn't -- he was living his law-abiding everyday life when the government put him on the No Fly List.He still doesn't know why he was put on the No Fly List. And so I think that is -- because the No Fly List operates under that cloak of secrecy, that that creates a problem for them meeting their burden.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Can I -- under what circumstance can the government stop the case that was already in motion at the time that it was legitimately -- you know, stop a case that was legitimately started pursuant to Article III.It's on the government then to show that this is now moot as a result of something that they did.\nGadeir Abbas: Yes, Your Honor, it is on the government.And -- and -- and, here, what -- what underscores Your Honor's point is that Yonas Fikre doesn I think that gets into the merits now, and the merits would for procedural due process require a balancing, a balancing of the government's interests, a balancing of the alternatives available to the government and pursuing the interests, as well as the risk of erroneous deprivation. The stronger the reason that the government has for the deprivation, the -- the lower the risk of erroneous deprivation is going to be.And so, if the government has a -- a -- an overwhelming reason to put Yonas on the No Fly, if the government has a -- a -- an overwhelming reason to put Yonas on the No Fly List like as the hypotheticals suggest, that's going to -- that's going to be enough to get the government where it wants to go with this case.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: And from our standpoint, just in terms of how we're supposed to be looking at this, at least as I thought, aren't we isolating the merits by essentially assuming for the purpose of Yonas's fact. But the opposite is also true.The government could do something that's only specific to Yonas Fikre.For example, if the procedural safeguards that the Court put in place -- that the government put in place were not generally applicable but were only specific to Yonas Fikre, this Court could look at those procedural safeguards and say, hey, before the government relists him, they're going to call this lawyer and they're going to call -- it's going",

"What argument does Sopan Joshi present to support the claim of mootness?": ", then mootness seems like very easy to establish under the standard that we have. When it's this kind of, well, connecting the dots situation, it's much harder, I think, to squeeze it into reasonably expected to recur because we just have no idea.\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.So two -- two responses to that. One, I -- I think you hit the nail on the head with the dynamic nature of these things.It's not like, you know Joshi: So --\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: All right.So I understand here that what we're really talking about is the extent to which the government can rely on voluntary cessation to claim that he no longer has a -- a claim.And I think that's slightly different than an analysis of whether or not he would have had standing to bring this in, you know, under these circumstances if -- if for no to the extent your circumstances change, we now move into the realm of evaluating it under mootness, right?\nSopan Joshi: That's correct, but I'll point out that Already, which was a case about mootness, did mention that, you know, in these circumstances where the -- the claim is no longer really live, that cases like Lyons and Article III apply with equal force, that a litigant cannot just rely on speculative injuries to keep the case alive. So force, that a litigant cannot just rely on speculative injuries to keep the case alive. So mootness and standing should not be interpreted to be that different from each other because both are implementing Article III's case or controversy requirement.And that's why, as I was mentioning to Justice Kavanaugh earlier, I think, we -- we shouldn't interpret the two exceptions to -- to mootness that make it more flexible than standing unmoored from the purposes for which those exceptions were developed, which was.S. person, I guess.\nSopan Joshi: And for Article III purposes, I think this Court has always been reluctant to rely on past instances in order to --\nKetanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi, this is not sort of a general Article III.I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused about your references to Lyons.Was that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.\n that would satisfy him? And I think he had trouble answering that for a reason.There really is nothing we could say that would satisfy his test for mootness.So it would always have to go to the merits. And to be clear, many of the things that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's questions for a declaration to say were essentially repudiation.And if I leave you here with one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness. confuses mootness with the merits.As this Court has explained, a case can be moot no matter how vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit. Respondent's new test isn't much better because it too can be satisfied solely by repudiation of the past conduct.And that persistent focus on repudiation and the past I think lays bare what's really going on in this case.The complaint isn't really concerned about Respondent's potentially being put back on the No Fly",

"How does Joshi respond to the Ninth Circuit's view on mootness?": " Joshi: So --\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven concerns. And I think that's entitled to deference and -- and respect.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Jackson?\nKetanji Brown Jackson: So I just want to be clear.Are you asking for a special mootness rule for the national security context?\nSopan Joshi: No.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: Are we doing some sort of a carveout for national security?\nSopan Joshi: No, quite the opposite.S. person, I guess.\nSopan Joshi: And for Article III purposes, I think this Court has always been reluctant to rely on past instances in order to --\nKetanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi, this is not sort of a general Article III.I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused about your references to Lyons.Was that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.\n that would satisfy him? And I think he had trouble answering that for a reason.There really is nothing we could say that would satisfy his test for mootness.So it would always have to go to the merits. And to be clear, many of the things that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's questions for a declaration to say were essentially repudiation.And if I leave you here with one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness. that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: All right.So I understand here that what we're really talking about is the extent to which the government can rely on voluntary cessation to claim that he no longer has a -- a claim.And I think that's slightly different than an analysis of whether or not he would have had standing to bring this in, you know, under these circumstances if -- if for no one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness.So, at a minimum, the Ninth Circuit's test is wrong.No one seems to be defending it, but I just want to make that clear.It sounded like there was maybe some appetite for a holding that says, okay, repudiation is not required, the Ninth Circuit is wrong, but if the government is going to keep the underlying information classified, then a district judge should review it inan Joshi: So that is exactly what we do when these cases get to the merits.If he had remained on the No Fly List, that's what would have happened.That's what happens in the other cases.There's no question, Justice Gorsuch. My only point is, in the mootness context, there has been no district court that has attempted to invoke those kinds of procedures.We haven't faced that.And the reason I think is that mootness, the Article III inquiry confuses mootness with the merits.As this Court has explained, a case can be moot no matter how vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit. Respondent's new test isn't much better because it too can be satisfied solely by repudiation of the past conduct.And that persistent focus on repudiation and the past I think lays bare what's really going on in this case.The complaint isn't really concerned about Respondent's potentially being put back on the No Fly",

"What does Justice Clarence Thomas ask regarding the procedures used to place Fikre on the list?": " old and Respondent has been off the list for the past eight of them.There simply isn't a live case or controversy any longer, and this Court should hold as much. I welcome the Court's questions.\nClarence Thomas: Well, the Respondent was also concerned about the propriety of the procedures that were used to put him on the list to begin with and challenged that. So how does the declaration that you all used, how does that change the procedures that he thought were the procedures, again, I'll -- I'll just say procedures in a vacuum you can't challenge unless you're substantively going to be subjected to them.So then that's --\nClarence Thomas: Yeah, I understand that, but we know nothing.We don't -- how would he know a year from now if he is on the list with the same procedures or different procedures or different facts when he doesn't know why he was on the list in the first instance?\nS he's not -- we're not on going to put him on the list for the same reasons.\nGadeir Abbas: Well, for example, Your Honor, they could moot the procedural due process claim without disclosing any reasons at all about why Mr. Fikre was put on the list because that just deals with the procedures itself. On the -- on the substance -- on the reasons, you're right, Your Honor, that it's -- it's -- it's up to the government for example, of his lawful, peaceful associations in his religious community as a basis for his listing, or it could be that the standard was inadequate -- was so low that it allowed anything to sail right through to the list.\nElena Kagan: If -- if --\nSonia Sotomayor: Can -- go ahead.\nElena Kagan: If -- if we thought that a reasonable way to deal with this really quite difficult situation is for the government to do what it doesJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre. Mr. Joshi.\nSopan Joshi: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's No Fly List claims are moot.He's not on the list.He hasn't been on the list in eight years.And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently't be challenged.\nClarence Thomas: But how would we know, for example, and how would he know that you have not -- that any circumstances or any procedures are different if he's put on the list in the future when we don't know the procedures or the circumstances that got him on the list?\nSopan Joshi: So let me take those two separately.With the procedures, again, I'll -- I'll just say procedures in a vacuum you can't challenge good reasons.And we can't decide the merits of the case. I think that Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical is an extremely important one because it really asks, what does this declaration commit you to? The declaration clearly says that you can't use any facts that you know of now, so any facts that have happened in the past cannot be used to -- to relist Mr. Fikre. But the question that she's asking is, if he does the same kinds of things, do it to where it's really necessary and where the inquiry is not an actual evaluation by the court as to substantively whether we -- whether he was appropriately put on the list, not in -- you know, for protected conduct, et cetera, which is a merits question, when the question is simply we all agree he's not on the list now, hasn't been on the list, is assured he's not going to be put back on the list based on what we know about him",

"How does Joshi respond to concerns about procedural challenges in Fikre's case?": " of a carveout for national security?\nSopan Joshi: No, quite the opposite.I -- we rely extensively, I didn't think it was possible to rely more heavily, on a case than we do on -- than on Already.That was a case involving private parties.We think exactly the same rule applies. We do think the national security context does matter for an evaluation of the facts on the ground.I think it's Respondent who would have a heightened rule for government real quick. Does the government dispute that Mr. Fikre had standing at the time that he filed his suit in 2013?\nSopan Joshi: No.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: All right.So he did.And don't we ordinarily assess standing at the time the person brings the lawsuit? If you have standing to bring -- to file the lawsuit, then, to the extent your circumstances change, we now move into the realm of evaluating it under mootness, address the claim made by Respondent and some of the amici that the government, in fact, is strategically mooting these cases by dismissing them?\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.We strongly disagree with that, and I don't think the evidence they cite actually supports the claim. I think the ACLU's brief is probably the most comprehensive on this front, but if you look at the ACLU's brief, what they say is -- you know, sometimes, I -- I think it's Joshi: So --\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven So how does the declaration that you all used, how does that change the procedures that he thought were violative of his rights?\nSopan Joshi: So two responses. As far as a procedural challenge goes, number one, for the post-deprivation procedures, those have actually already changed since the time he was first on the list. I take the point that maybe he wants some pre-deprivation procedures.Those haven't changed.But I think Alvarez pretty squarely fore committed to our voluntary cessation rule, which I think we've given every indication we are extremely committed to.\nSopan Joshi: No, you are.But -- but the inquiry, of course, is going to be like, is it reasonably expected to occur in the future? And precisely because it's based on a totality of circumstances that's ever changing, that even the passage of time itself can cause information that once seemed suspicious not to appear so anymore, the lack of corroboration can can you have satisfied our standard?\nSopan Joshi: I think because there's a difference between an allegation of what we did in the past or what he might have done in the past and an expectation that he's going to satisfy the standard for No Fly List inclusion in the future. And -- and I take the point that he's worried that he's going to do the same things and -- and land back on it.I understand that. But I think this Court's case law back on is entirely speculative. So, anyway, that's why I find it perplexing.\nSopan Joshi: I -- I -- I take the point.So let me try and address both pieces of that. First, as to, you know, the probability of recurrence or whatever, yes, it is our burden.We -- we agree with that.We acknowledge that. I guess what I would say is I would fall back on the fact that the standard is poses a",

"What hypothetical scenario does Justice Sonia Sotomayor present to question the declaration\u2019s effectiveness?": "Sopan Joshi: So I -- again, I would want to know more about exactly --\nSonia Sotomayor: There is nothing more.You put him on because he did a fundraiser for this mosque.Will this declaration stop you tomorrow from putting him on the list for doing a fundraiser for that mosque?\nSopan Joshi: So I'll answer you directly, but I need to -- I feel compelled to, despite the premise --\nSonia Sotomay good reasons.And we can't decide the merits of the case. I think that Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical is an extremely important one because it really asks, what does this declaration commit you to? The declaration clearly says that you can't use any facts that you know of now, so any facts that have happened in the past cannot be used to -- to relist Mr. Fikre. But the question that she's asking is, if he does the same kinds of things, you have standing for that remedy?\nGadeir Abbas: Yes.\nSonia Sotomayor: Let's clarify. Are you seeking an injunction? Are you seeking just a declaration? And why would the declaration not violate the law that the other side claims it would?\nGadeir Abbas: Yes, Your Honor.We're -- we're seeking an injunction and a declaratory judgment. The -- the injunction is the same injunction that we saw at the beginning of the case wouldn't presumably reveal classified information, but --\nSonia Sotomayor: It wouldn't.But it would -- it would basically say whatever ground that the court has looked at wasn't sufficient to put him on the list, so if he repeats that conduct, he won't be put at risk.\nSopan Joshi: So, again, we think the Courtright declaration actually tells that to him, that he's not going to be put back on the list --\n the government willing to say, and it turns out that the government is not willing to say a word more than what's in the Courtright declaration.\nNeil Gorsuch: Worth a try. (Laughter.)\nSonia Sotomayor: Can we go back to Justice Alito's earlier question of your -- of the opposing side? What's the remedy you're seeking and how do you have standing for that remedy?\nGadeir Abbas: Yes.\nSonia Sotom don't want to jump into a hypothetical where --\nSonia Sotomayor: That's the -- that's the point, isn't it?\nSopan Joshi: Huh?\nSonia Sotomayor: That without a declaration that basically says, for this activity, whatever that might be, we're not going to put him on the fly list, then how is the case mooted?\nSopan Joshi: I -- I don't think activity is responsibilities in good faith, it's evaluating people against the standard correctly, and even if the allegation is that it didn't do that at time one, we -- we cannot reasonably expect the government to fall down and act in bad faith at time two.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Sotomayor?\nSonia Sotomayor: I -- I -- I think you're right that he's given up injunction, but he wants a declaration.You don't think a declaration problem for them meeting their burden.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Can I --\nSonia Sotomayor: Would you answer --\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: -- come back to the question of what might be said in a declaration that would be sufficient to show that it was sufficiently unlikely that he would be put back on the list?

"What concern does Justice Samuel Alito raise regarding the mootness of the case?": " Joshi: So --\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven the challenge was moot. And I think that just goes back fundamentally to the -- the principle behind Article III standing and mootness, which is you can't -- you no longer have a live challenge to procedures if, substantively, you're not subjected to those procedures or can't show that it's imminent that you're going to be subjected to those procedures.Procedures in a vacuum just can't be challenged.\nClarence Thomas: But how would we know, for example, and concerns. And I think that's entitled to deference and -- and respect.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Jackson?\nKetanji Brown Jackson: So I just want to be clear.Are you asking for a special mootness rule for the national security context?\nSopan Joshi: No.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: Are we doing some sort of a carveout for national security?\nSopan Joshi: No, quite the opposite expect the plaintiff even to be arrested again, so too should it not reasonably expect its citizen to pose a threat of engaging in terrorist activities and then just say what I think should be obvious from common sense, which is there is no case or controversy here any longer, there is no injunctive or declaratory relief that could be issued that would solve any injury he currently or imminently will suffer, and call this case what it is, moot.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: is so evanescent that ordinary judicial review won't complete or because of docket manipulation and gamesmanship.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, is the upshot of what you've said that Article III can't be satisfied in this case unless the -- the basis for putting him on in the first place and taking him off later is disclosed at least to the judge? And so that's what this is all about. I'll ask your -- your -- your -- your friend that would satisfy him? And I think he had trouble answering that for a reason.There really is nothing we could say that would satisfy his test for mootness.So it would always have to go to the merits. And to be clear, many of the things that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's questions for a declaration to say were essentially repudiation.And if I leave you here with one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness.'re accepting that it's moot under a circumstance in which the government takes him off the No Fly List and then we're looking at is there an exception to mootness in this situation. Instead, we're saying has the government actually mooted the case when it takes him off the No Fly List, right?\nSopan Joshi: Well, I'm not sure about that.I mean, Justice Scalia dissented in Friends of the Earth.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: Yes.S. person, I guess.\nSopan Joshi: And for Article III purposes, I think this Court has always been reluctant to rely on past instances in order to --\nKetanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi, this is not sort of a general Article III.I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused about your references to Lyons.Was that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.\n",

"What is Joshi's main defense regarding the unlikelihood of Fikre's return to the No Fly List?": " exists.And so, here, Mr. Fikre has an interest in the government not returning to its old ways, and so it maintains the interest in the injunction. But there's even more concrete things. The government, by standing by its prior decision, indicates an interest in continuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that the government is likely to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact that not going to reconsider this decision because you won't be put back on the No Fly List based on the currently available information. So it adds a stickiness to that determination.So it's not a matter of grace, and it's sticky and so isn't likely going to be revoked in the future.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: All right.Let me ask you about the standing question real quick. Does the government dispute that Mr. Fikre had standing at the time that heJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre.

And so I think that is -- because the No Fly List operates under that cloak of secrecy, that that creates a problem for them meeting their burden.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Can I -- can you have satisfied our standard?\nSopan Joshi: I think because there's a difference between an allegation of what we did in the past or what he might have done in the past and an expectation that he's going to satisfy the standard for No Fly List inclusion in the future. And -- and I take the point that he's worried that he's going to do the same things and -- and land back on it.I understand that. But I think this Court's case law Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: Are you just saying that's --\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: But suppose --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- are you saying that's unlikely?\nSopan Joshi: It's a very rare thing. There are very, very, very few U.S. persons on the No Fly List who satisfy that criteria.It's exceedingly rare.And I take the point that he satisfied it different facts when he doesn't know why he was on the list in the first instance?\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.So -- so that's the key.He does know why he's on the list, and we've -- we've made this public, which is the standard to be on the No Fly List, in addition to reasonable suspicion that you're a known or suspected terrorist, is also you must pose a threat of conducting or engaging in one of four enumerated acts of to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact that the government for a period of five years put him on the No Fly List.And so the Court, this Court or another, lower courts, can order the government to not use his past No Fly List status for any particular purpose.

Alito, Jr.: Do you think that's wrong?\nGadeir Abbas: Well, I -- I -- I think that there are things that the government could put in its declaration.They could put a description of the notice, the opportunity to the government could put in its declaration.They could put a description of the notice, the opportunity to be heard in the declaration.They could disclose the reasons and make a promise that matches those reasons.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, counsel.\nGadeir Abbas: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Jackson? Thank you very much. Rebuttal, counsel.\nSopan Joshi.\nAmy Coney Barrett: I was just going to ask you, do you have any response to the Respondent's argument that Mr. Courtright doesn't even really have the ability to bind the government?\nSopan Joshi: So we -- we -- it was a declaration filed in court under penalty of perjury.Of course, a future president could come in and withdraw it.But the same is true of his repudiation request as well.If Mr. Courtright engaging in international terrorism in that --\nElena Kagan: I mean, Mr. Joshi, you're -- you're -- you're arguing the merits of the case.You obviously think that you have good reasons for putting people on the list. And, you know, on the other hand, the -- the suit, the whole gravamen of the complaint, is that you were not using good reasons.And we can't decide the merits of the case. I think that Justice Sotom",

"What does Brett M. Kavanaugh question about Sopan Joshi's argument on recurring threats?": "i: And so it would always have to get to the merits.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: No, I think it's -- yeah, if the court knew.The problem is, for us, to try to assess --\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- the standard that you and Justice Alito were discussing is very challenging --\nSopan Joshi: It is, but --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- when weSopan Joshi: Right.So, I mean, I think, again, it's -- he says -- his argument is that he doesn't know what put him on the list. But, if that's -- if that's the claim, then I -- I think, you know, you -- you would -- I think the voluntary cessation exception really would swallow the rule. So, to get back to something I mentioned to you earlier, Justice Kavanaugh, you know, what if, for get back to something I mentioned to you earlier, Justice Kavanaugh, you know, what if, for example, a court were to see this information and determine, oh, it's very unlikely for it to recur, I think, on Respondent's argument, the case still wouldn't be moot because he wouldn't know.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: Right.\nSopan Joshi: And so it would always have to get to the merits.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh if --\nSopan Joshi: Well, if you accept Respondent's submission in this case or the Ninth Circuit's, it's not just going to be a few more cases; it's going to be literally anyone who's ever on the No Fly List, the claims could never moot out unless we --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: Right.\nSopan Joshi: -- revealed the information, then, you know, there is a point of minimization.Even, of a carveout for national security?\nSopan Joshi: No, quite the opposite.I -- we rely extensively, I didn't think it was possible to rely more heavily, on a case than we do on -- than on Already.That was a case involving private parties.We think exactly the same rule applies. We do think the national security context does matter for an evaluation of the facts on the ground.I think it's Respondent who would have a heightened rule for government -- the fifth piece of it again.\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.So --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: It would be silly for the government to say, oh, this person is never going to be on the list again.That would be --\nElena Kagan: Irresponsible.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- that would be totally irresponsible, right?\nSopan Joshi: Right.So, I mean, I think, again, it's actually tells that to him, that he's not going to be put back on the list --\nSonia Sotomayor: No, because you --\nSopan Joshi: -- based on the currently available information.\nSonia Sotomayor: -- we can go -- we go -- go back to the fundraising.But, anyway.\nSopan Joshi: Well, but --\nSonia Sotomayor: Okay.Thank you, counsel.\nI don't --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: I think that might be right, I mean -- I mean, just based on the theory of the other side, though, because you're not going to have the information to know whether the person might engage in the -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the fifth --\nSopan Joshi: So --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- the fifth piece of it again.\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.So --\n"}
