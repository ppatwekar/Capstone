    "What is the main legal issue in Case 22-1178 between the FBI and Yonas Fikre?": "John G. Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre. Mr. Joshi.continuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that the government is likely to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact that the government for a period of five years put him on the No Fly List.And so the Court, this Court or another, lower courts, can order the government to not use his past No Fly List status for any particular purpose. Annotate the records, that's something thatabroad he might be relisted, massively disrupting his life once again. Mr. Fikre is peaceful, a law-abiding U.S. citizen.He has a live controversy against the government and seeks only to litigate that case on the merits.That's it. I welcome the Court's questions.Sopan Joshi: I take the point, but -- but -- but imagine this.I mean, like, imagine if a court actually were to review it.Remember these are all very rare circumstances to begin with, right? It's a U.S. person posing a threat of engaging in terrorism.It's very rare that it happened.These are very rare circumstances that would lead to it. I'm not sure, even if a court were --were not generally applicable but were only specific to Yonas Fikre, this Court could look at those procedural safeguards and say, hey, before the government relists him, they're going to call this lawyer and they're going to call -- it's going to go to this committee and they're going to make sure that the terms of the Courtright declaration are implemented. So there's a way for the government to do it specific to Yonas.There's a way for the government toGadeir Abbas: Yes, Your Honor, it is on the government.And -- and -- and, here, what -- what underscores Your Honor's point is that Yonas Fikre doesn't -- he was living his law-abiding everyday life when the government put him on the No Fly List.He still doesn't know why he was put on the No Fly List. And so I think that is -- because the No Fly List operates under that cloak of secrecy, that that createsso Respondent's going to be in exactly the same position as if this Court just recognizes that, in this context, the standard for listing is so unusual, which is a U.S. citizen posing a threat of engaging in one of four enumerated terrorist activities, that just as the Court in Lyons was unwilling for Article III purposes to expect the plaintiff even to be arrested again, so too should it not reasonably expect its citizen to pose a threat of engaging in terrorist activities and then just say whatof procedures.We haven't faced that.And the reason I think is that mootness, the Article III inquiry, is different from the merits inquiry. For the Article III, you're trying to make a predictive judgment about expectation, and when the standard is threat of engaging in terrorism, I think district courts have sensibly realized that that is just not reasonably expected to occur and we shouldn't think it would for the same reason we wouldn't think Mr. Lyons would be arrested again.",

    "What argument does Sopan Joshi present to support the claim of mootness?": "Sopan Joshi: So that would certainly moot a case, but I think here it also moots it because these intelligence -- in the dynamic intelligence environment, every decision or delisting decision looks at the totality of circumstances at the point in time. And he was taken off not as a matter of grace.This isn't like the union fee return in Knox.It's not, you know -- this is -- it's not like the governor allowing the churches to get the playground funds inSopan Joshi: That's correct, but I'll point out that Already, which was a case about mootness, did mention that, you know, in these circumstances where the -- the claim is no longer really live, that cases like Lyons and Article III apply with equal force, that a litigant cannot just rely on speculative injuries to keep the case alive. So mootness and standing should not be interpreted to be that different from each other because both are implementing Article III'sSopan Joshi: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a few quick points. I think the discussion right now just indicates why there is no Article III case or controversy here because it really isn't redressable.I mean, I heard my friend agree that if he brought the suit today or even a day after I presume being taken off the list, there would be no standing. And if that's true, I don't think you should interpret mootness as being so disconnected from standingwho does, okay? If you said that, then mootness seems like very easy to establish under the standard that we have. When it's this kind of, well, connecting the dots situation, it's much harder, I think, to squeeze it into reasonably expected to recur because we just have no idea.Sopan Joshi: And I think that if you take -- if you accept that argument, Justice Kagan, I think you would essentially conclude that no No Fly List claim ever could be moot, and the voluntary cessation exception, the judge-made exception, to Article III would swallow the mootness rule.I don't --Sopan Joshi: Huh?\nSonia Sotomayor: That without a declaration that basically says, for this activity, whatever that might be, we're not going to put him on the fly list, then how is the case mooted?\nSopan Joshi: I -- I don't think activity is the right unit of analysis.When you're trying to decide whether something is moot --Sopan Joshi: So --Sopan Joshi: No.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: All right.So he did.And don't we ordinarily assess standing at the time the person brings the lawsuit? If you have standing to bring -- to file the lawsuit, then, to the extent your circumstances change, we now move into the realm of evaluating it under mootness, right?",

    "How does Joshi respond to the Ninth Circuit's view on mootness?": "a reason.There really is nothing we could say that would satisfy his test for mootness.So it would always have to go to the merits. And to be clear, many of the things that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's questions for a declaration to say were essentially repudiation.And if I leave you here with one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness.So, at a minimum, the Ninth Circuit's test isSopan Joshi: So that would certainly moot a case, but I think here it also moots it because these intelligence -- in the dynamic intelligence environment, every decision or delisting decision looks at the totality of circumstances at the point in time. And he was taken off not as a matter of grace.This isn't like the union fee return in Knox.It's not, you know -- this is -- it's not like the governor allowing the churches to get the playground funds inSopan Joshi: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a few quick points. I think the discussion right now just indicates why there is no Article III case or controversy here because it really isn't redressable.I mean, I heard my friend agree that if he brought the suit today or even a day after I presume being taken off the list, there would be no standing. And if that's true, I don't think you should interpret mootness as being so disconnected from standingJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Jackson?\nKetanji Brown Jackson: So I just want to be clear.Are you asking for a special mootness rule for the national security context?\nSopan Joshi: No.\nKetanji Brown Jackson: Are we doing some sort of a carveout for national security?Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument. But I'm equally perplexed by the fact because you have the burden of showing mootness. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing standing. So I'm not quite sure what good it would do the Petitioner -- I'm sorry, the Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot because the government hasn't proven that it's very unlikelyClarence Thomas: How would the government's declaration have to be amend -- amended in order to satisfy your notion of mootness?Ketanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi, this is not sort of a general Article III.I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused about your references to Lyons.Was that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.Sopan Joshi: So that is exactly what we do when these cases get to the merits.If he had remained on the No Fly List, that's what would have happened.That's what happens in the other cases.There's no question, Justice Gorsuch. My only point is, in the mootness context, there has been no district court that has attempted to invoke those kinds of procedures.We haven't faced that.And the reason I think is that mootness, the",

    "What does Justice Clarence Thomas ask regarding the procedures used to place Fikre on the list?": "Clarence Thomas: Well, the Respondent was also concerned about the propriety of the procedures that were used to put him on the list to begin with and challenged that. So how does the declaration that you all used, how does that change the procedures that he thought were violative of his rights?Clarence Thomas: Yeah, I understand that, but we know nothing.We don't -- how would he know a year from now if he is on the list with the same procedures or different procedures or different facts when he doesn't know why he was on the list in the first instance?Clarence Thomas: But how would we know, for example, and how would he know that you have not -- that any circumstances or any procedures are different if he's put on the list in the future when we don't know the procedures or the circumstances that got him on the list?Gadeir Abbas: Well, for example, Your Honor, they could moot the procedural due process claim without disclosing any reasons at all about why Mr. Fikre was put on the list because that just deals with the procedures itself. On the -- on the substance -- on the reasons, you're right, Your Honor, that it's -- it's -- it's up to the government to decide whether to disclose or not to disclose.And if the government chooses not to disclose, thatdecide the merits of the case. I think that Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical is an extremely important one because it really asks, what does this declaration commit you to? The declaration clearly says that you can't use any facts that you know of now, so any facts that have happened in the past cannot be used to -- to relist Mr. Fikre. But the question that she's asking is, if he does the same kinds of things, if he meets with the same kindsGadeir Abbas: Yes, Your Honor.I think that the only way to determine that would be to know the -- the reasons why he was listed and -- and to make sure that the government is not in a position to invoke those same unlawful reasons again.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: But what if they're --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: What --abroad he might be relisted, massively disrupting his life once again. Mr. Fikre is peaceful, a law-abiding U.S. citizen.He has a live controversy against the government and seeks only to litigate that case on the merits.That's it. I welcome the Court's questions.for protected conduct, et cetera, which is a merits question, when the question is simply we all agree he's not on the list now, hasn't been on the list, is assured he's not going to be put back on the list based on what we know about him, so now we're just speculating, well, is it possible he'll be put back on the list in the future --",

    "How does Joshi respond to concerns about procedural challenges in Fikre's case?": "Sopan Joshi: So let me take those two separately.With the procedures, again, I'll -- I'll just say procedures in a vacuum you can't challenge unless you're substantively going to be subjected to them.So then that's --abroad he might be relisted, massively disrupting his life once again. Mr. Fikre is peaceful, a law-abiding U.S. citizen.He has a live controversy against the government and seeks only to litigate that case on the merits.That's it. I welcome the Court's questions.John G. Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre. Mr. Joshi.Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right.Let me ask you about the standing question real quick. Does the government dispute that Mr. Fikre had standing at the time that he filed his suit in 2013?\nSopan Joshi: No.Sopan Joshi: So two responses. As far as a procedural challenge goes, number one, for the post-deprivation procedures, those have actually already changed since the time he was first on the list. I take the point that maybe he wants some pre-deprivation procedures.Those haven't changed.But I think Alvarez pretty squarely forecloses that challenge.In Alvarez, it was the same thing.The plaintiffs in that case complained about the procedures used to depriveSopan Joshi: No, you are.But -- but the inquiry, of course, is going to be like, is it reasonably expected to occur in the future? And precisely because it's based on a totality of circumstances that's ever changing, that even the passage of time itself can cause information that once seemed suspicious not to appear so anymore, the lack of corroboration can change how you view things. Because of that, I think a court just from institutional competence would have aSopan Joshi: So that would certainly moot a case, but I think here it also moots it because these intelligence -- in the dynamic intelligence environment, every decision or delisting decision looks at the totality of circumstances at the point in time. And he was taken off not as a matter of grace.This isn't like the union fee return in Knox.It's not, you know -- this is -- it's not like the governor allowing the churches to get the playground funds indecide the merits of the case.

Are you seeking just a declaration? And why would the declaration not violate the law that the other side claims it would?Sopan Joshi: So I -- again, I would want to know more about exactly --\nSonia Sotomayor: There is nothing more.You put him on because he did a fundraiser for this mosque.Will this declaration stop you tomorrow from putting him on the list for doing a fundraiser for that mosque?\nSopan Joshi: So I'll answer you directly, but I need to -- I feel compelled to, despite the premise --Elena Kagan: I mean, Mr. Joshi, you're -- you're -- you're arguing the merits of the case.You obviously think that you have good reasons for putting people on the list.

He does a fundraiser for his mosque.He has no idea that the mosque is under suspicion.You put him on the No Fly List.You now give him this declaration that says on the -- we're not going to put you on the No Fly List for anything that's happened in the past.

    "What concern does Justice Samuel Alito raise regarding the mootness of the case?": "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So that's -- that's why I'm perplexed by your mootness argument.

That's true with you or I or anyone else.And there's no reason why he has a live case just because it also happens to be true with respect to him. Justice Alito, I think you -- you asked him, you know, what could the government say in a declaration that would satisfy him? And I think he had trouble answering that for a reason.There really is nothing we could say that would satisfy his test for mootness.SoClarence Thomas: How would the government's declaration have to be amend -- amended in order to satisfy your notion of mootness?John G.

And to be clear, many of the things that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's questions for a declaration to say were essentially repudiation.And if I leave you here with one thought today, it's that repudiation cannot be an element of the test for mootness.So, at a minimum, the Ninth Circuit's test isSopan Joshi: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a few quick points. I think the discussion right now just indicates why there is no Article III case or controversy here because it really isn't redressable.I mean, I heard my friend agree that if he brought the suit today or even a day after I presume being taken off the list, there would be no standing. And if that's true, I don't think you should interpret mootness as being so disconnected from standingKetanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi, this is not sort of a general Article III.I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused about your references to Lyons.Was that a mootness case?\nSopan Joshi: It was a standing case.no live case or controversy.So even if you were to -- to say that the case isn't moot, I don't think he would be entitled to any relief at the end of the day, which I think just underscores why the case is moot. I mean, mootness and standing are both attempts to implement Article III's case or controversy requirement.I understand that mootness is a little more relaxed than standing, but both of the exceptions that make it a little more relaxed are all about",

    "What is Joshi's main defense regarding the unlikelihood of Fikre's return to the No Fly List?": "Sopan Joshi: I think because there's a difference between an allegation of what we did in the past or what he might have done in the past and an expectation that he's going to satisfy the standard for No Fly List inclusion in the future. And -- and I take the point that he's worried that he's going to do the same things and -- and land back on it.I understand that. But I think this Court's case law has drawn that distinction. So evenSopan Joshi: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's No Fly List claims are moot.He's not on the list.He hasn't been on the list in eight years.And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently available information.That makes it absolutely clear that his return to the list for the same reasons he was put on it initially can't reasonably be expected to recur. Now the Ninthcontinuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that the government is likely to consider about Yonas Fikre when it runs into him in the future is the fact that the government for a period of five years put him on the No Fly List.And so the Court, this Court or another, lower courts, can order the government to not use his past No Fly List status for any particular purpose. Annotate the records, that's something thatGadeir Abbas: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government agrees that when a defendant voluntarily ceases conduct challenged in litigation, it has a heavy burden to make absolutely clear that the conduct could not reasonably be expected to recur.But the Courtright declaration just promises Mr. Fikre that he won't be put back on the No Fly List based on currently available information. That's in -- inadequate for three reasons.First, if our client was previouslySamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, Mr. Joshi -- I'm sorry.Finish your sentence.I -- I do find this a very perplexing case because you -- you have to show, in order to establish that the case is moot, that putting it in maybe simpler terms than we have used in our opinions, it's very unlikely or maybe very, very unlikely that he will again be put on the No Fly List.Do you agree with that?is because the voluntary cessation doctrine isn't -- isn't exactly an exception to mootness.It's when mootness exists.And so, here, Mr. Fikre has an interest in the government not returning to its old ways, and so it maintains the interest in the injunction. But there's even more concrete things. The government, by standing by its prior decision, indicates an interest in continuing to use his past No Fly List status in the future. Among many of the things that theSopan Joshi: Yeah.We strongly disagree with that, and I don't think the evidence they cite actually supports the claim. I think the ACLU's brief is probably the most comprehensive on this front, but if you look at the ACLU's brief, what they say is -- you know, sometimes, I -- I think it's about half or something like that, roughly, of these plaintiffs are removed from the No Fly List during the litigation. Of course, that's the --Sopan Joshi: So that is exactly what we do when these cases get to the merits.If he had remained on the No Fly List, that's what would have happened.That's what happens in the other cases.There's no question, Justice Gorsuch. My only point is, in the mootness context, there has been no district court that has attempted to invoke those kinds of procedures.We haven't faced that.And the reason I think is that mootness, the",

Are you seeking an injunction? Are you seeking just a declaration? And why would the declaration not violate the law that the other side claims it would?Elena Kagan: If -- if we thought that a reasonable way to deal with this really quite difficult situation is for the government to do what it does on the merits part of the cases and go in and tell the judge in -- in camera why the person was listed and why the person was taken off and what it has to say about why the person won't be taken off, do you know anything about how that process works? Is -- is counsel part of that process typically when it'sSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: Do you think that's wrong?\nGadeir Abbas: Well, I -- I -- I think that there are things that the government could put in its declaration.They could put a description of the notice, the opportunity to be heard in the declaration.They could disclose the reasons and make a promise that matches those reasons.\nJohn G.

I think that Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical is an extremelySamuel A.

Alito, Jr.: Do you think that's wrong?John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Sotomayor?\nSonia Sotomayor: I -- I -- I think you're right that he's given up injunction, but he wants a declaration.You don't think a declaration that said he wasn't -- he attended a mosque, that wasn't enough to put him on the list would help so that he could go back to the same mosque?Amy Coney Barrett: Mr. --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: Would your argument be different if it were just a year after?\nSopan Joshi: Not necessarily.I think the -- the eight years underscores the fact that these sorts of determinations are sticky, and I think the declaration makes it sort of sticky, and I think it makes it sticky enough, especially in this context where the standard is reasonable expectation --\nNeil Gorsuch: Well, counsel --",
    
    "What does Brett M. Kavanaugh question about Sopan Joshi's argument on recurring threats?": "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right.\nSopan Joshi: And so it would always have to get to the merits.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: No, I think it's -- yeah, if the court knew.The problem is, for us, to try to assess --\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- the standard that you and Justice Alito were discussing is very challenging --Sopan Joshi: I --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: It's a total wild card whether the person's going to send an email to, you know, al Qaeda in West Africa again if they've done it before.\nSopan Joshi: I -- I take the point, but this Court, for Article III purposes, has frequently said that past instances of misconduct by the plaintiff do not allow us to infer that he'll engage in that misconduct again.Sopan Joshi: Right.So, I mean, I think, again, it's -- he says -- his argument is that he doesn't know what put him on the list. But, if that's -- if that's the claim, then I -- I think, you know, you -- you would -- I think the voluntary cessation exception really would swallow the rule. So, to get back to something I mentioned to you earlier, Justice Kavanaugh, you know, what if,Sopan Joshi: It is, but --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: -- when we are in the dark about what's going on.Sopan Joshi: I think because there's a difference between an allegation of what we did in the past or what he might have done in the past and an expectation that he's going to satisfy the standard for No Fly List inclusion in the future. And -- and I take the point that he's worried that he's going to do the same things and -- and land back on it.I understand that. But I think this Court's case law has drawn that distinction. So evenBrett M.

Kavanaugh: -- the fifth piece of it again.\nSopan Joshi: Yeah.So --Ketanji Brown Jackson: But, Mr. Joshi --\nBrett M. Kavanaugh: Are you just saying that's --\nJohn G.

Kavanaugh: This whole thing's based on associations, though.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.: You're begging the question when you say they're lawful, peaceful associations.Let's say all they know is that he's associating with a particular person and that's a suspicious person and they don't know why he's associating with the person."
