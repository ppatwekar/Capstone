{"What is the main legal issue being discussed in this case?": "presented is not one so esotery that it cannot be dealt with in a judicial proceeding. Now let me turn to the claim that the requirement of the statute that the court may have to balance, convenience and needs or probable effects on convenience and needs against any competitive consequences, somehow imposes upon the court a burden which is so foreign to foreign to it that it raises serious constitutional questions as to the appropriate division of legislative and judicial responsibility. I'm frank to say that we have great difficulty understanding the courtsthan Judge Clarie had to dispose of this matter on a matter of pleading. Normally of course we don't.\" Then he said to the attorney for the Department of Justice, \"The defendants and the intervener as I understand it, such authorities are here seem to say, that it is necessary for you to allege, (a), that the effect would be anticompetitive, and (b), that it is not outweighed by the convenience and need. It seems to me as simple ascorrect. Now, and with regard to the kinds of issues as I were saying, it seems to me that all of the issues that have been mentioned in the appellee's brief in this case and the Comptroller's brief esoteric as they may sound in a way they were put can all be translated into issues which are the kinds of issues that the courts have repeatedly dealt with in antitrust cases. The courts have long dealt with all manner of issues bearing on the competitive consequences of mergers. Theythat the issue that's posed there is one (Inaudible) in the competence and familiarity of the courts. Now, the example I was about to get to which I think boils down to this issue, is a claim that -- to rely it on the Houston case that the increased size of this bank will contribute to growth and employment, in this case in the Houston area. The Comptroller -- and I quote said in his opinion, \"The failure of the Houston banks to keep paced with theDonald F. Turner: Well this really takes me into the -- into what I think is the heart of the issue. I mean, the basic claim that is being made exclusively by the appellees now in the Provident case or by the Comptroller's office is that what is involved here are issues which are just not suitable for determination by the court. Now I think really the argument breaks down into two parts, first that the banking agencies have greater expertise in assessing the various factual issues thatthe third question which are the question which both Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Fortas have alluded to and that is what finality should be accorded to that determination by the agency? Now, I feel this has -- there are two factors to this. One, how good is the procedure before the agency and what kind of a review procedure should there be before the court? Perhaps we can illustrate that best by the facts of this case by which I mean the Provident case as they areDonald F. Turner: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. If I may again briefly recapitulate, I'm now taking up the question whether the courts are so incapacitated for dealing with the kinds of issues that are involved in proceedings of this kind that despite what we think is the plain meaning of a statute and the plain implication of legislative history, this Court should read in a review standard of some kind and needless to say we think the courts clearly are not. ThereHugo L. Black: Under your argument, doesn't do any good to give the court a review on that point, they can't do anything about it. \nJoseph J. O'Malley: The court can review -- the court can in effect arrive on its own determination as to competition in the competitive effect. \nHugo L. Black: But not this other point?", 

"What is the role of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 in this case?": "the Bank Merger Act of 1966 were met by the bank regulatory agency. That is, its determination was correctly that either the statute did not substantially lessen competition or that if it did that that was all the common public interest by the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In that event, the Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that the courts must in the first instance apply the same standard and in the -- Section 7 (b), and Section 7 (c) of the Bank Mergermain reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee in the House. The bill would've established a single set of standards for the consideration of future mergers by the banking supervisory agencies, the Department of Justice, and the courts. And what was this single set of standards? The Court said, \"It would include both the effect of the merger on competition and the convenience and needs of thewhat the Bank Merger Act has done has modified and supplied a new set of standards, the precise (Inaudible) meaning of which is yet to be determined in the cases that come up and in specific context but which leaves unimpaired and unlimited in any substantial way the role of the court in deciding the issues laid before it and making the conclusion of the statute that directs it to make is correct. Now, and with regard to the kinds of issues as I were saying, it seems toAnd then, the Bank Merger Act of 1966 said, \"In every case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future's prospects of the existing and proposed institutions and the convenience and needs of the community to be served and further provides that courts should follow the same standards in a suit -- in a judicial proceeding.\"Eugene J. Metzger: No, let me explain this to you sir. The Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that in any suit, you shall apply the standards of this Act. Now let us take any possible instance in which a bank merger might arise. The banks proposed a merge. No suit can arise until the bank merger -- the bank regulatory agency approves that merger since -- that is a requirement of the statute. So we start from the premise that any bank merger asEugene J. Metzger: The application of the precise terms of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 precludes the application -- \nHugo L. Black: But -- \nEugene J. Metzger: -- of the Clayton 7. \nHugo L. Black: -- does it say so?Bank Merger Act of 1966 has an effect only upon the Comptroller. But as far as the judicial proceeding is concerned, it is only a Section of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act which were applicable. And I on this case, the trial court sustained a motion to dismiss stating that the plaintiff's complaint does not beat -- meet the basic minimum standards of notice pleading in that it has not alleged a violation of BMA 66, the Act that applies to all bank mergers.Subsequent to the Act's passage, the three-judge court in the Northern District held a further hearing and invited all parties to submit additional evidence and at that time the Comptroller of the Currency intervened as a party in accordance with the right given to him by the Bank Merger Act. They also -- and by the briefs -- and in its brief, the Department took the position, \"It is of course the essential position of the Government that the 1966 amendment to the Bank Merger Act has",

"What specific argument does Mr. Turner present regarding the court\u2019s review of banking agency determinations?": "Donald F. Turner: To the determination Mr. Justice as such, it seems to me none. To expertise on particular issues, I don't think there's any single answer to that. That is in urging of this Act does not give the court simply a review function for reviewing the determination of the Comptroller. We are not urging for the other banking agency, we are not urging at all that the expertise of those agencies to the extent that it exist and with regard to the particular issues inDonald F. Turner: Well this really takes me into the -- into what I think is the heart of the issue. I mean, the basic claim that is being made exclusively by the appellees now in the Provident case or by the Comptroller's office is that what is involved here are issues which are just not suitable for determination by the court. Now I think really the argument breaks down into two parts, first that the banking agencies have greater expertise in assessing the various factual issues thatEarl Warren: United States, Appellant, versus First City National Bank of Houston. Mr. Turner you may continue your argument.Donald F. Turner: Have never been tried because of the summary nature of the proceedings before the banking agency. Now, I would like to make just two or three points in connection with the legislative history to indicate why it is we think the conclusion we urge is correct. One is this, the primary purpose of the Act, one of the primary purposes of the Act was clearly to eliminate the application of disparate standards among the banking agencies and between the baking agencies in the courts. It is -- orDonald F. Turner: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. I will simply continue my discussion of the nature -- of what we view to be the nature issues in this case only briefly restating before I proceed our principal -- the principal arguments I have covered as to why we believe under the Bank Merger Act the court is still as in any antitrust case required to make an independent determination and I will simply, briefly summarize the points we think the statute is clear in a wayDonald F. Turner: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. Very briefly, we have before us two cases involving bank mergers and dismissal of complaints brought by the Government involving interpretation of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and more particularly the following provisions. The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger, the responsible banking agency whose approval is required shall not approve any proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to substantially lessenendeavored to discuss one issue raised by the Houston banks in their case, namely an issue -- a claim that the dismissal in that case was simply on the basis that the Government has failed to allege facts concerning convenience and needs rather than on the basis that the Government had failed to meet the burden of proof on both competitive needs and the competitive consequences and convenience and needs. Today I want to address myself to what we deem to be the two major issues on the case which are closely interrelated. And theDonald F. Turner: Well, that's my impression of what their argument is that it is not appropriate for a court to make decisions of this kind. I think one of the problems with the argument is that the banks and the Comptroller have described what I would call simply factual issues as policy issues. Let me give you an example from the appellees' brief in the Provident case on page 30, they say, \"In the final analysis, public interest means what is good for",

"How does Justice Brennan question the significance of the terms 'trial de novo' and 'review de novo'?": "Hugo L. Black: What's the meaning of trial de novo? \nEugene J. Metzger: For the word trial de novo has been variously interpreted because of its constitutional difficulties, initially to hold a trial without reference to the decision below but a number of courts in order to preserve -- \nHugo L. Black: That's the way it's treated throughout the nation, isn't it?William J. Brennan, Jr.: Mr. Turner. \nDonald F. Turner: Yes? \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: Is my recollection accurate, that the -- this provision reviewed de novo come really from a proposal of the Attorney General by letter? \nDonald F. Turner: That is correct sir. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: And didn't that letter suggest that the provision provide for a trial de novo?the Attorney General who existed -- a legislation which would have removed antitrust jurisdiction to the end would hardly calculate that they abused the phrase review de novo in his own proposed statute, if it had the consequences that the appellees now contend that it does. Now -- but for the problem Mr. Justice Brennan that you have just raised, namely whether there is any peculiar significance in the use of the word review as opposed to trial, it seems to us that the words of the statute clearly give to theHugo L. Black: Is there a provision for review de novo to the product of the Department of Justice's effort in connection with those bills? \nDonald F. Turner: That was, that language is precisely the language that the Attorney General proposed -- \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: What do you -- \nDonald F. Turner: -- in his letter. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- understand of review de novo means?position of the appellees argue that it does, to me it's manifest from reading the opinion that the court is using the words trial and review de novo interchangeably. The statute as I said uses the word trial de novo, courts to review and will set aside the determination, it found to be unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo. That was the statute the court was interpreting in that case. And later on, the courtDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- but isn't the expression of review de novo unusual? Do you know of -- do you any other statutes there?Eugene J. Metzger: It -- the term review -- trial de novo was in the September 24th letter objecting to 11011. Now there was no reference of any kind in the letter of January 5th to review de novo. The term was contained in the attachment to say as -- dismissed within Section 7 with no -- with reference in the text to the letter to it at all. The text of the letter adverted to Section 5 which proposed to change theDonald F. Turner: No, I don't. And as a matter of fact, the statute that was involved in the Smithfield case which is cited rather heavily by appellees in both of these cases did not itself use the phrase review de novo. It used the word trial de novo. And I must say having read the case that I failed to see how it supports the position of the appellees argue that it does, to me it's manifest from reading the opinion",

"What was the primary purpose of the Bank Merger Act according to Donald F. Turner?": "Donald F. Turner: I am simply contending a -- suggesting that with regard to this particular area, it seems clear to us from the legislative history that among the things of principal concern to Congress was a feeling that the standards of the bank agencies were applying in approving or disapproving mergers were quite dissimilar from those that had been applied by the courts. To be specific, I'm sure it was felt. Indeed, I think it was suggested at more than one point that the banking agenciesDonald F. Turner: There was or thought to be -- there was -- or there was or thought to be by the Congress a difference in approach. And I must say I don't suppose anybody really disputes that proposition. And what we are suggesting is that the purpose of the Bank Merger Act was to -- as best as you can, eliminate that difference. And my argument is that you don't eliminate it by applying -- by putting the courts in the position of applying a review standard. Particularlymain reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee in the House. The bill would've established a single set of standards for the consideration of future mergers by the banking supervisory agencies, the Department of Justice, and the courts. And what was this single set of standards? The Court said, \"It would include both the effect of the merger on competition and the convenience and needs of theDonald F. Turner: That is correct. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: And I take it that you say that the Congress really intended to have the courts, as an original matter, apply the standards of the -- \nDonald F. Turner: Bank Merger Act. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- Bank Merger Act, including the needs of the community.Donald F. Turner: Oh! \nAbe Fortas: Well, I -- it slipped my mind now but -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes, I think -- I have the Committee report here and it says the major purpose of the bill is to resolve the apparently conflicting interpretations which have been made -- given the Bank Merger Act of 1960. This is the House Report to the company declining the bill that was passed.Donald F. Turner: The other way around in the Houston case. But this is a factor commonly relied on. Now, this incidentally is an issue of substance on which in any antitrust proceeding I am sure that we and the banking agencies are rather going to -- are going to rather sharply conflict because an issue we will always raise against the claim of that kind is whether the merger is necessary to resolve the management problem that has been relied upon by the Comptroller. There are other ways of solving managementByron R. White: But what if a -- one of the Bank -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nByron R. White: -- Merger Act indicated is the needs of the community, so to speak, taken into account, namely the -- \nDonald F. Turner: Well -- \nByron R. White: -- the benefit of having a local source of a large -- of larger loans hadn't been able to be made locally before.Donald F. Turner: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. Very briefly, we have before us two cases involving bank mergers and dismissal of complaints brought by the Government involving interpretation of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and more particularly the following provisions. The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger, the responsible banking agency whose approval is required shall not approve any proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to substantially lessen",

"What issue did Abe Fortas raise regarding uniformity in the banking industry?": "Abe Fortas: Is there anything in a banking situation that makes that uniformity more desirable than in other parts of our economy that tells us if you apply for the argument you've just made to other parts of our economy, Mr. Turner has suggested that you have been -- reconsidered all the problems of whether the quasi judicial administrative agencies aren't desirable. For example I have a recollection that there are certain overlaps between the court jurisdiction at the instance of the Department of Justice and the jurisdictionAbe Fortas: Well, that's my problem because I'm restricted to words. \nJoseph J. O'Malley: The last paragraph of his opinion which appears on page 112 B of the appendix of the Philadelphia Bank -- \nAbe Fortas: That's exactly that confuses me.Abe Fortas: He then say which he used, does he? \nJoseph J. O'Malley: He decided first that there was no substantial anticompetitive effect under the terms of the new statute which according to the legislative history, we believe, permits, and requires the courts to take into consideration all the financial institutions -- \nAbe Fortas: Could you show --Eugene J. Metzger: Yes. \nAbe Fortas: The reactions of business leaders and so on.Donald F. Turner: Yes. \nAbe Fortas: Isn't that right? \nDonald F. Turner: Sir? Well, I beg your pardon? \nAbe Fortas: Isn't that correct, that the -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nAbe Fortas: -- the section 7 uses the words in any line of commerce, the Bank Merger Act in stating what appears to be the exact standard of section--Abe Fortas: Now it seems to me that it's arguable that that is a very important indication that this is a different -- a new standard that the Congress enacted and is applicable to bank mergers in displacement of the Section 7 Clayton Act standard. I'm not saying that that is so and -- that I do suggest that that is a point that you have to meet because if that is so, then the conclusion may follow that it was the intent of Congress that the governing standard inAbe Fortas: Well, wouldn't it be exactly -- \nDonald F. Turner: -- to base on the kind of the statute that we have here. \nAbe Fortas: Wouldn't it be exactly the same problem if there is under Administrative Procedure Act in the event that the Comptroller refused to approve a merger? And now the banks since started a proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act and don't you have all -- having these problems all over again right there?Abe Fortas: (Inaudible) \nDonald F. Turner: -- suggested by the Administrative Procedure Act.",

"What was William J. Brennan, Jr.\u2019s interpretation of the government's stance on agency roles in court?": "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Mr. Turner, may I ask -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: May I just ask you -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- to ask a question. It does seem to me that the Government's position really reducing the agency in the proceeding in court pretty much to the role of an expert witness.Joseph J. O'Malley: The Department arrest -- the Department relies Mr. Justice Fortas upon several cases in which the court has apparently done that, the California, the FTC, the El Paso case, the Philadelphia National Bank case and I believe there's another one, the RCA case. And yet in the California case, this Court in writing its opinion pointed out that in all of these cases that the Department is relying upon, there was no permissive legislative scheme by which the agencyWilliam J.

O'Malley: If there has been no hearing and insufficient record, then it must find that the Comptroller was -- \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, I think that's -- \nJoseph J. O'Malley: -- arbitrary and capricious. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- the ordinary agency review.William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, how about the matter for example of managerial reporting of which much was made as I recall it in the Comptroller's defense (Voice Overlap) -- \nDonald F. Turner: I in the abstract Mr. Justice Brennan really say how expertise would play a role there. Now, one of the disputes -- \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, is that (Inaudible) --William J. Brennan, Jr.: -- the ordinary agency review. \nJoseph J. O'Malley: That is correct Your Honor.William J. Brennan, Jr.: Yes. \nDonald F. Turner: In the actual court proceeding, when particular issues came up that may have peculiar aspects about them on which the banking agency may have expertise, the court may well pay that rather high regard.Joseph J. O'Malley: Yes, yes. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: If the Act can't go further than what you are about -- rather tell me. \nJoseph J. O'Malley: The court may assess the competitive factors and determine whether or not the -- \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: No (Voice Overlap) -- \nJoseph J. O'Malley: -- substitute its own opinion there.",

"What concern did David T. Searls express regarding the burden of proof?": "David T. Searls: Your Honor I don't think -- as I said on the previous page, at the beginning of this Appendix, the Court said, \"Well, the burden, I am not too much concerned about the burden of proof but is what is actually necessary for you to allege?\" I think the trial court only determined the question of pleading, what was necessary to allege. But he analyzed the authorities to hold that the burden was on the plaintiff to allege and prove.Hugo L. Black: The burden of proof is on the defendants? \nDavid T. Searls: They say that you have to raise it as a defense, and of course it may or may not be raised as a defense that depends -- its optional where the defendant what defense will they raise of course. And I'm won't -- I'm going to come to that matter Your Honor.to sustain it's case and it came out in the course of our various submissions that we were not prepared and we did not believe we had to assume the burdens which has pretrial order indicated -- he thought which he had assumed. And it was because of that, that the motion to dismiss were removed and the judge then granted the motion. Now on the burden of proof, I would again point to the language of the statute and what we think is the plain implication of the House Report and was pertinentbetween the court and the counsel for the Department of Justice. The Court said, \"Well, the burden, I am not too much concerned about the burden of proof, but as to what is actually necessary for you to allege. That is what we are concerned about here.\" The court rather said, \"I recognized full will that this is very important and serious litigation. And I have no more desire than Judge Clarie had to dispose of this matter on a matter of pleading. Normally of course weDonald F. Turner: I might think -- \nByron R. White: -- laws must be alleged and proved by those who rely on it. \nDonald F. Turner: Well, I think it's broader than that Mr. Justice White. I think most of the usual questions you asked, when you're asked where should the burden of proof lie fall in our favor in this of a question. \nByron R. White: But in this particular --Hugo L. Black: Am I wrong in thinking that the only real basic difference between you and the Government on that is that they agree that you've got to weigh it and balance, they claim that it's your burden of proof? \nDavid T. Searls: They claim it's a defensive matter. \nHugo L. Black: Yes, they claim it.Hugo L. Black: No, I thought they admitted that the new Act made it necessary to consider the question of convenience to the community but that the burden of proof was on the defendant.Earl Warren: But wasn't the suggestion that they amend their complaint based upon on the assumption that they would carry the burden, that they claim in this Court they're not entitled to -- are not required to carry it. \nDavid T. Searls: Well certainly -- ordinarily, the burden of proof follows the burden of pleading, I agree with that. \nEarl Warren: Yes.",

"What was the position of the Department of Justice in the trial courts on the standards to be applied to bank mergers?": "think that was the only issue before the trial court. Now, Your Honor I want to submit that the position taken by the Department of Justice before Your Honors is entirely different from the position taken in these six cases in the trial court. The Department of Justice has taken a consistent position in the trial court that Section 7 governs Bank Merger Act by the bank mergers even since the Bank Merger Act of 1966. I think it is clear from the position that they're taking in the trialwhere the banking -- Bank Merger Act says that if the Department of Justice starts a suit to the court, the court shall review de novo the issues --I could state a little more clearly that what you're not telling us is that if the banking agency disapproves a merger proposal, the parties can then go into the District Court and that the standard in the District Court will be whether the agency action is arbitrary etcetera. But now you tell us that -- and what I'm suggesting is the possibility that whether that same standard could've been applied here where the banking -- Bank Merger Act says that if the Department of Justice starts a suit to theDavid T. Searls: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. There have been six decisions rendered ever since the passage of the merger -- Bank Merger Act of 1966 by the trial courts, the federal trial courts. Each of those six decisions is contrary to an adverse to the Government in this case. In each of those six cases, the trial judge held that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 was the controlling statute. One of those six decisions is a three-judgeBank Merger Act of 1960, there was no provision that the Department of Justice and the courts had to follow the same test and the same standards that the Comptroller was required to follow. This Court recognized that fact to be true and said that the Bank Merger Act of 1960 did not change the substantive test to be applied in a suit claiming a violation of antitrust laws. That was one of the main reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and providechallenged the failing-company doctrine. And this goes directly to the constitutional issue which is involved in this case. The authorization of a merger by a banking agency is a function that under this Act is delegated directly to that agency by the Congress. And it is definitely a legislative act being performed by the Comptroller or the banking agency involved. Convenience and needs means nothing more than competition, then obviously the courts have always been considered competent to assess competitive effects and it's properly a judicial function. Butmain reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee in the House.

In the entire years of 1965, only one merger was attacked by the Department of Justice, so that the -- the expertise of the Department in its responsible ability that the effectuation of a national banking policy is a function that was given to it by the Congress, and upon that rest of course our constitutional argument that deals --",
