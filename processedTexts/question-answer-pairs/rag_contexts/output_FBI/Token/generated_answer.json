        "question": "What is the main legal issue in Case 22-1178 between the FBI and Yonas Fikre?",
        "answer": "The main issue is whether Fikre's claims regarding his placement on the No Fly List are moot, as he has not been on the list for eight years and, according to the government, is unlikely to be put back on it.",
        "generated": "The main legal issue in Case 22-1178, FBI v. Yonas Fikre, is whether the government can use Fikre's past inclusion on the No Fly List in future decisions, and whether such actions violate his due process rights. The case also examines whether Fikre is entitled to an injunction preventing the government from using his past status in the future, given the lack of transparency and opportunity for him to challenge his original placement on the list.",

        "question": "What argument does Sopan Joshi present to support the claim of mootness?",
        "answer": "Joshi argues that because Fikre is no longer on the No Fly List and the government has no intention of putting him back on it, the case is moot since there is no reasonable expectation of recurrence of his placement on the list.",
        "generated": "Sopan Joshi argues that the case is moot because there is no live dispute, and speculative future injuries cannot keep it alive. He rejects using repudiation of past conduct as grounds to avoid mootness, emphasizing that mootness requires an ongoing controversy, not just a focus on past actions.",

        "question": "How does Joshi respond to the Ninth Circuit's view on mootness?",
        "answer": "Joshi contends that the Ninth Circuit confused mootness with the merits of the case by suggesting that the government must agree with Fikre's contentions to render the case moot, which Joshi argues is incorrect.",
        "generated": "Joshi rejects the Ninth Circuit's mootness test, arguing that repudiation of past conduct cannot determine mootness. He emphasizes that mootness should focus on whether a live controversy remains, not on whether the government has ceased the action. He believes the Ninth Circuit's reliance on repudiation conflates mootness with the merits, which is flawed.",

        "answer": "Justice Thomas asks if the government\u2019s declaration changes the procedures Fikre originally challenged as violating his rights.",
        "generated": "Justice Clarence Thomas asks how Fikre could know if the procedures or reasons for placing him on the No-Fly List have changed, since he was never informed of the original procedures or reasons.",

        "question": "How does Joshi respond to concerns about procedural challenges in Fikre's case?",
        "answer": "Joshi explains that post-deprivation procedures have already changed, but pre-deprivation procedures have not, and claims that without current exposure to those procedures, Fikre\u2019s procedural challenge is moot.",
        "generated": "Sopan Joshi argues that post-deprivation procedures for Fikre have already changed, and while pre-deprivation procedures are not in place, the government is committed to voluntary cessation. He contends that concerns about future recurrence are speculative due to changing criteria for the no-fly list.",

        "question": "What hypothetical scenario does Justice Sonia Sotomayor present to question the declaration\u2019s effectiveness?",
        "answer": "Sotomayor asks if Fikre could be put back on the No Fly List if he engages in similar activities, such as holding a fundraiser for a mosque, even if he was previously removed from the list for such actions.",
        "generated": "Justice Sotomayor questions whether a declaration would prevent the government from placing someone back on a watchlist in the future for similar actions, like hosting a fundraiser for a mosque, thus challenging its effectiveness.",

    {
        "question": "How does Joshi respond to Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical about re-listing Fikre for similar activities?",
        "answer": "Joshi states that No Fly List decisions are based on a totality of information, not specific activities, but ultimately answers 'yes' to whether Fikre could be re-listed for similar activities if they meet the threat criteria.",
        "generated": "Joshi responds by stating that the declaration prevents re-listing Fikre based on past activities. He argues the case isn't moot because the government's reasons for the list should be respected, despite the hypothetical.",

        "question": "What concern does Justice Samuel Alito raise regarding the mootness of the case?",
        "answer": "Justice Alito expresses confusion about how the government can prove the case is moot without clarifying the reasons for Fikre\u2019s original listing and removal, given that any new relevant circumstance could potentially place him back on the list.",
        "generated": "Justice Alito raises concerns about mootness, questioning whether the case should be dismissed simply because the government removed the individual from the No Fly List. He suggests that without knowing the reasons behind the initial placement and removal, the case may still involve a live controversy about the procedures used. Alito emphasizes that mootness requires showing no ongoing or imminent harm, and he is unsure if that has been demonstrated here.",

        "question": "What is Joshi's main defense regarding the unlikelihood of Fikre's return to the No Fly List?",
        "answer": "Joshi argues that based on Article III principles, it is unreasonable to expect Fikre, a U.S. person, to engage in or pose a threat of engaging in terrorist acts again, given the criteria used for placement on the list.",
        "generated": "Joshi's main defense regarding the unlikelihood of Fikre's return to the No Fly List is that it is exceedingly rare for U.S. persons to be placed on the list again once they have been removed. He argues that Fikre's past inclusion on the list does not mean he is likely to be added again, especially given that he does not know the specific reasons for his original inclusion and the government has not presented new evidence suggesting he would meet the criteria for re-inclusion. Furthermore, Joshi emphasizes that the government's stance is not one of grace but rather a 'sticky' decision, meaning it is unlikely to reverse based on the current information.",

        "question": "What clarification does Justice Elena Kagan seek regarding the declaration's commitment?",

        "generated": "Kavanaugh questions how to assess recurring threats in national security cases, noting it would be irresponsible for the government to claim someone will never be placed on the No Fly List again.",
