    "What is the main argument presented by Mr. Mitchell regarding Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment?": "Jonathan F. Mitchell:  So in just as a matter of first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much harder argument for us to make because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has been treated as self-executing. What we would argue in the hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3 that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes toClarence Thomas:  Mr. Mitchell, would you -- you didn't spend much time on your argument with respect to whether or not Section 3 is self-executing, so would you address that?  And  -- and in doing that, your argument is that it's not self-executing, but then, in that case, what would the role of the State be, or is it entirely up to Congress to implement the disqualification in Section 3?John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Why don't we  -- \nBrett M. Kavanaugh:  -- Griffin's Case is also relevant to trying to figure out what the original public meaning of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment is?  It's by the Chief Justice of the United States a year after the Fourteenth Amendment. That seems to me -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yes.Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Well, they had the quo warranto provision that was in effect then from 18 -- 1870 until 1948, but then, obviously, that dropped out and hasn't been seen as necessary since then. Last question. In trying to figure out what Section 3 means and kind of to the extent it's elusive language or vague language, what about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people to elect candidates of their choice, of lettingJonathan F. Mitchell:  But we aren't relying necessarily on the thought processes of the people who drafted these provisions because they're unknowable. But, even if they were knowable, we're not sure they would be relevant in any event because this language, especially in Section  3, was enacted as a compromise. There were certainly radical Republicans who wanted to go much further if you look at some of the earlier drafts that were proposed. Some people wanted to ban all insurrectionists from holdingJonathan F. Mitchell:  We  --we made -- \nAmy Coney Barrett:  He had no due process right? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  We made that argument below. We did not make that in our briefs to this Court for several reasons. I mean, Your Honor's, I think, suggesting and this is correct that the proceedings below, to put it charitably, were highly irregular.favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes to I think the policy concerns he talks about, where this was a case -- Griffin's Case involved a convicted criminal who was seeking a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the judge who tried his case was an insurrectionist disqualified under Section 3, and Chief Justice Chase realizes that if he enforces Section 3 in this situation, it would nullify every official act taken not only by this particularSonia Sotomayor:  -- and to my colleagues generally. There's a whole lot of examples of states relying on Section 3 to disqualify insurrectionists for state offices, and you're basically telling us that you want us to go two steps further. You want to -- maybe three. You want us to say that self-execution doesn't mean what it generally means. You want us now to  say it means that Congress must permit states or require states to stop insurrectionists",

    "How does Mr. Mitchell interpret the term 'officer of the United States' in the Constitution?": "\"an officer of the United States\" as that term is used throughout the Constitution. \"Officer of the United States\" refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the President or members of Congress. This is clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which uses \"officer of the United States\" to refer only to appointed and not elected officials. The second reason is that Section 3 cannotpursuant to Article II. So there is this gap between the term \"officer\" and the phrase \"officers of the United States,\" reinforcing the idea that \"officers of the United States\" is a term of art that doesn't refer just to federal officeholders, which is what the Anderson litigants are cl aiming, but refers only to those who are appointed, not to those who are elected.Jonathan F. Mitchell:  Perhaps, but there are al so implications from other parts of the Constitution which really help us on the \"officer of the United States\" argument in that second part of Section 3 but somewhat cut against us when it comes to \"office under the United States.\" And the Anderson litigants point this out in Footnote 9 in the red brief where they say, if this Court were to say the presidency is an excluded office under the United States, that couldElena Kagan:  Thank you. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Thanks. \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch? \nNeil Gorsuch:  Do you want to respond to some of the specific textual arguments on the \"officer of\" with respect to the Appointments Clause, the Impeachment Clause, and some of the others? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yeah. So the way -- let's start with --Jonathan F. Mitchell:  That -- that's certainly an argument in our favor, but there are also  -- with respect to \"officer of the United States,\" that's used repeatedly in the Constitution and the Commissions Clause and the Appointments Clause and also in the Impeachment Clause, and every time it appears, it's used in a way that clearly excludes the president. \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  No, I understand.argument than the \"office under.\" We're not conceding \"office under,\" but we definitely have the stronger textual case and structural case on \"officer of the United States.\"the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House are officers of the United States because the Constitution says they are, but we also know that they don't hold an office under the United Stat es because of the Incompatibility Clause that says they can't. So maybe the Constitution to us today, to a lay reader, might look a little odd in distinguishing between \"office\" and \"officer,\" not prepositions, nouns, a distinction. But maybe that's exactlyJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yeah, I would say it a little more forcefully than what Your Honor just described. We believe the presidency is excluded from \"office under the United States,\" but the argument we have that he's excluded, the president, as an officer of the United States is the stronger of the two textually. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Ah. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  It has fewer implications for other constitutional --",

    "Why does Mr. Mitchell believe the Colorado Supreme Court's decision should be reversed?": "Jonathan F. Mitchell:  -- seems to suggest that there might be due process issues. But we didn't develop that argument in this Court for several issues. Winning on due process doesn't really do as much for our client as the other arguments that we've made because that would be a ruling specific to this particular proceeding in the State of Colorado and would leave the door open for Colorado to continue on remand to exclude him from the b allot.Jonathan F. Mitchell:  I think they all mutually reinforce each other. We have an argument, we believe, that is sufficient to dispose of this case just based on the meaning of \"officer of the United States,\" as well as the argument we're making based on Term Limits, but all of the consequentialist considerations that Your Honor has suggested are additional reasons to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court, although we don't think it's necessary to get into consequences because the law is clearly on ourJonathan F. Mitchell:  And the -- the answer to all three of those questions turns on whether this Court agrees with the holding of Griffin's Case. If Griffin's Case is the proper enunciation of the law, then a state cannot do any of the things Your Honor suggested unless Congress gives it authority to do so through implementing legislation.John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, what do you do with the -- what would seem to me to be plain consequences of your position. If  -- if Colorado's position is upheld, surely there will be disqualification proceedings on the other side. And some of those will succeed. Some of them will have different standards of proof. Some of them will have different  rules about evidence. Maybe the Senate report won't be accepted. In others because it's hearsay. Maybeagainst former President Trump and so the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court could effectively decide this question for many other states, perhaps all other states? Could it not lead to that consequence?Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Final question. The Colorado Supreme Court concluded that the violent attempts of the Petitioner's supporters in this case to halt the count on January 6th qualified as an insurrection as defined by Section 3. And I read your opening brief to accept that those events counted as an insurrection, but then your reply seemed to suggest that they were not. So what is your position as to that?Jonathan F. Mitchell:  So in just as a matter of first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much harder argument for us to make because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has been treated as self-executing. What we would argue in the hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3 that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes toJonathan F. Mitchell:  No. \nAmy Coney Barrett:  Why? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Not if  --not if Griffin's Case is correct. So a court would have to reject the rationale of Griffin's Case to accept what Your Honor was suggesting. \nAmy Coney Barrett:  Well, why?  Like I said, Griffin's Case -- I mean, I think there's some language that might be a little bit broad --",

    "What example does Mr. Mitchell give to argue that states cannot impose additional qualifications for federal office?": "Jonathan F. Mitchell:  Right. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Is -- are your arguments limited to Section 3? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Not quite. The question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the state is violating Term Limits by adding to or altering the extant qualifications for the presidency in the Constitution. Now the hypo  --Jason C. Murray:  Well, Your Honor, the examples are states excluded many candidates for state office, individuals holding state offices. We have a number of published cases of states concerning that.Jonathan F. Mitchell:  Yes. \nAmy Coney Barrett:  And you also said that it has to apply, you know, after one is holding office, is elected. And I'm asking whether then the implication of your argument is that Congress could not enact such a provision that applied against federal officeholders that were covered by Section 3 as opposed to state ones?Neil Gorsuch:  All right. But just circle back to where we started, right?  This is Section 3. Your authority has to come from there. And it's about holding office and it's a particular kind of disability that can be removed by Congress and it's the only one like that, right?  They can't remove age or citizenship. How should that inform our thoughts about a state's efforts to regulate the ballot for a federal office?Neil Gorsuch:  Yeah, I would think so. So it has to come back to Section 3. And if that's true, how does that work given that Section 3 talks about holding office, not who may run for office. It was a point Mr. Mitchell was making earlier and I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to it because it seems to me that  --that, you know, that you're asking to enforce in an election context a provision of the Constitution thatShannon W. Stevenson:  Sure. I think that the fact that the write-in candidate also had to be qualified was confirmatory of the fact that the political party candidate also had to be qualified, and it would be otherwise incongruous to read those things differently. \nClarence Thomas:  So how is Section 3 a qualification? \nShannon W. Stevenson:  Under the reasoning of the Colorado Supreme Court  --under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states have the power to enforce Section 3, just like they do other presidential qualifications, and I would defer to the electors arguments on those points.Clarence Thomas:  Do you have contemporaneous examples -- and by contemporaneous, I mean shortly after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment  --where the states disqualified national candidates, not its own candidates, but national candidates?",

    "How does Justice Thomas question Mr. Mitchell regarding Section 3’s implementation?": "Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Mitchell, would you -- you didn't spend much time on your argument with respect to whether or not Section 3 is self-executing, so would you address that?

Murray:  I'd like to make three points on that, Justice Kavanaugh. The first is that constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of safeguarding our democracy not just for the next election cycle but for generations to come. And, second, Section 3 is designed to protect our democracy in that very way. The Framers of Section 3 knew from painful experience that those who had violently broken their oaths to the Constitution couldn't be trusted to hold power again because they could dismantle ourJonathan F. Mitchell:  Mm-hmm. \nSonia Sotomayor:  -- Section 3 as executing itself, needing no legislation o n the part of Congress to give it effect. So you're relying on a non-precedential case by a justice who later takes back what he said.Jonathan F. Mitchell:  It did away with it later. But, as -- \nSonia Sotomayor:  But -- but that has nothing to say with respect to what Section 3 means. Can we get to the issue, which is, I think, one that I go back to that I started with, and -- and very briefly, what sense does it say that states can't enforce Section 3 against their own officials?Jonathan F. Mitchell:  Not that I'm aware, Justice Alito, because of Griffin's Case. I mean, Griffin's Case has been the law -- and I shouldn't say that it's been the law because it was just a circuit court decision, but that has been the settled understanding of Section 3 since 1870 when it was decided. \nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.Jonathan F. Mitchell:  It is entirely up to Congress, Justice Thomas. And our argument goes beyond actually saying that Section 3 is non-self-executing. We need to say something more than that because a non-self-executing treaty or a non-self-executing constitutional provision normally can still be enforced by a state if it chooses to enact legislation. The holding of Griffin's Case goes beyond even that by saying that a state is not allowed to implement or enforce Section",
