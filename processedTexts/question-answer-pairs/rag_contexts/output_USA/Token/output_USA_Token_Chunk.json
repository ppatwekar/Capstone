{"What is the main legal issue being discussed in this case?": " case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future's prospects of the existing and proposed institutions and the convenience and needs of the community to be served and further provides that courts should follow the same standards in a suit -- in a judicial proceeding.\" \nHugo L. Black: Am I wrong in thinking that the only real basic difference between you and the Government on that is that they agree that you've got to weigh it and balance, they claim that it's your making the conclusion of the statute that directs it to make is correct. Now, and with regard to the kinds of issues as I were saying, it seems to me that all of the issues that have been mentioned in the appellee's brief in this case and the Comptroller's brief esoteric as they may sound in a way they were put can all be translated into issues which are the kinds of issues that the courts have repeatedly dealt with in antitrust cases. The courts have long dealt with all manner. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. I think there's only one issue that we care to comment on any further unless the court has further questions. I believe that all of the questions that have been raised as to just how a review procedure suggested by the appellees in these cases would work opposes the issue very sharply as to whether a statute like the one we have here really contemplates what they suggest. Mr. Ballard and the Comptroller in various ways attempt to resolve the questions thatI recognized full will that this is very important and serious litigation. And I have no more desire than Judge Clarie had to dispose of this matter on a matter of pleading. Normally of course we don't.\" Then he said to the attorney for the Department of Justice, \"The defendants and the intervener as I understand it, such authorities are here seem to say, that it is necessary for you to allege, (a), that the effect would be anticompetitive, and (b), that which is so foreign to foreign to it that it raises serious constitutional questions as to the appropriate division of legislative and judicial responsibility. I'm frank to say that we have great difficulty understanding the courts with this argument because what it's really saying is that courts cannot weigh and balance conflicting interest. \nHugo L. Black: Has there had to be any of -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nHugo L. Black: -- in the past -- \nDonald F. of issues that are involved in proceedings of this kind that despite what we think is the plain meaning of a statute and the plain implication of legislative history, this Court should read in a review standard of some kind and needless to say we think the courts clearly are not. There are, as I suggested really two issues here or it breaks down into two parts. One, whether the banking agencies have a greater expertise or -- let me put it differently, whether the courts lack expertise in assessing the various factual issues to allege, (a), that the effect would be anticompetitive, and (b), that it is not outweighed by the convenience and need. It seems to me as simple as that.\" Then he further said, \"I think it is just a question as to whether or not you have alleged the cause of action or if you ought to amend and undertake to do so, if you haven't already done it.\" The trial judge almost solicited the Department of Justice in this case to come this case, if the Department of Justice had any issues to take, there was ample opportunity to refine and define those issues so that when it went before the court, the court would know where the parties were in dispute as to either what the facts were or what weight should be assigned to it. The second thing that had happened in this case is there had been a complete discovery and the Department had asked -- had filed lengthy interrogatories asking -- going down through the application itself and asking what is the ground", 

"What is the role of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 in this case?": " application of the precise terms of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 precludes the application -- \nHugo L. Black: But -- \nEugene J. Metzger: -- of the Clayton 7. \nHugo L. Black: -- does it say so? \nEugene J. Metzger: No, let me explain this to you sir. The Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that in any suit, you shall apply the standards of this was correctly that either the statute did not substantially lessen competition or that if it did that that was all the common public interest by the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In that event, the Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that the courts must in the first instance apply the same standard and in the -- Section 7 (b), and Section 7 (c) of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 provides that in the event of the standards of BMA 66 have been made by the them into court. They needed to say, \"We don't need the Bank Merger Act of 1966, we must -- we can sue under our own statutory standards.\" Now we shall demonstrate that Clayton 7 no longer applies to banking and Justice's suit consequently to quote Judge Clarie below, lies within the ambit of BMA 66. \nHugo L. Black: May I ask you if it's in the language in the Bank Merger Act which supports that? \nEug's suit must be predicated upon and taken from the Bank Merger Act of 1966. If that is so, the internal logic of that statute requires with us to considerate as a review of the statute and a review standard the Justice must apply. It was for this reason that the court below suggested that the -- the Justice below suggested that Clayton 7 still applied. They needed an independent statute to get them into court. They needed to say, \"We don't need the Bank Merger Act of the convenience and needs suggested in the brief of the Department of Justice. Rather -- it was the decision of the lower courts that Section 7 of the Clayton Act have been supplanted as the legislative test of bank mergers by the new, substantively distinct statutory scheme embodied in the Bank Merger Act of 1966. This standard was rejected by the Department of Justice and the courts below. They flatly denied that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 had any substantive effect as Mr. Searls quoted from the court should consider also that mergers and the approval of mergers that its only one function of a banking agency. It must effectuate a national banking policy particularly the Comptroller of the Currency who has charged the chartering, branching, and merging in the National Banking System and that the mergers are but a small part of -- for example the United States last year, there are 35 more bank charters than there were mergers. In the entire years of 1965, only one merger was attacked by more particularly the following provisions. The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger, the responsible banking agency whose approval is required shall not approve any proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or in which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee in the House. The bill would've established a single set of standards for the consideration of future mergers by the banking supervisory agencies, the Department of Justice, and the courts. And what was this single set of standards? The Court said, \"It would include both the effect of the merger on competition and the convenience and needs of the community.\" Those are the two elements that make up the",

"What specific argument does Mr. Turner present regarding the court\u2019s review of banking agency determinations?": " the Court shall be identical with those the banking agencies are directed to apply under Paragraph 5, the paragraph which I just quoted. Now yesterday, I endeavored to discuss one issue raised by the Houston banks in their case, namely an issue -- a claim that the dismissal in that case was simply on the basis that the Government has failed to allege facts concerning convenience and needs rather than on the basis that the Government had failed to meet the burden of proof on both competitive needs and the competitive consequences and convenienceEarl Warren: United States, Appellant, versus First City National Bank of Houston. Mr. Turner you may continue your argument. \nDonald F. Turner: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. Very briefly, we have before us two cases involving bank mergers and dismissal of complaints brought by the Government involving interpretation of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and more particularly the following provisions. The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger -- the standard is what is the nature of the review that's taken place here. Is it a general judicial review of the decision of the regulatory agency wherein the court reserves to itself questions of law and statutory standards? Or is it, as Justice claims, not a review at all? But an independent inquiry untainted by the conclusions of the bank regulatory agency, a mere image of the Bank Merger Act in 1960. We believe that the procedure of difficulties which this Court found to be a fatal imped to the determination made by the banking agency, that is to say the kind of review standard that would be applied, say by the Court of Appeals in reviewing the action of the ordinary administrative agency made on the basis of the full hearing and the full record. Second, assuming that this is not so, that it is the function of the court to make an independent determination and come to its own conclusion whether the burden of proof is on the Government to allege and prove not only the necessary anticompetitive consequences of issues that are involved in proceedings of this kind that despite what we think is the plain meaning of a statute and the plain implication of legislative history, this Court should read in a review standard of some kind and needless to say we think the courts clearly are not. There are, as I suggested really two issues here or it breaks down into two parts. One, whether the banking agencies have a greater expertise or -- let me put it differently, whether the courts lack expertise in assessing the various factual issues as to the weight to be given, the Comptroller's opinion and decision. The trial judge was merely holding in this case, you have to bring the case under the Bank Merger of 1966. You have to allege in your complaint those issues, those standards which make up the test or the Bank Merger of 1966. Now, it's clear that the trial judge is passing on a pleading question and we have setout in our -- in the appendix to our brief, a colloquy between the Government had failed to meet the burden of proof on both competitive needs and the competitive consequences and convenience and needs. Today I want to address myself to what we deem to be the two major issues on the case which are closely interrelated. And the first is whether the Bank Merger Act of 1966 contemplates that in an antitrust proceeding, the function of the court really is to apply a review standard to the determination made by the banking agency, that is to say the kind of review standard that would what we view to be the nature issues in this case only briefly restating before I proceed our principal -- the principal arguments I have covered as to why we believe under the Bank Merger Act the court is still as in any antitrust case required to make an independent determination and I will simply, briefly summarize the points we think the statute is clear in a way that it reads, it provides that the court shall apply the identical standards which the agency is directed to apply, and clearly a review standard would not",

"How does Justice Brennan question the significance of the terms 'trial de novo' and 'review de novo'?": "\nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- but isn't the expression of review de novo unusual? Do you know of -- do you any other statutes there? \nDonald F. Turner: No, I don't. And as a matter of fact, the statute that was involved in the Smithfield case which is cited rather heavily by appellees in both of these cases did not itself use the phrase review de novo. It used the word trial de novo. And I must, I -- \nDonald F. Turner: There's no particular significance to be attached -- \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, I -- \nDonald F. Turner: -- to one or the other. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: I guess will ultimately with the statutes which provides the trial de novo -- \nDonald F. Turner: Yes. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: -- but isn't the expression of review de novo unusual Comptroller.\" As I said it seems to me that as far as that court was concerned, there was no particular significance in using one word or the other. I must say that the Attorney General who existed -- a legislation which would have removed antitrust jurisdiction to the end would hardly calculate that they abused the phrase review de novo in his own proposed statute, if it had the consequences that the appellees now contend that it does. Now -- but for the problem Mr. Justice Brennan that you haveHugo L. Black: Through trial de novo? \nEugene J. Metzger: A number of courts having -- in order to preserve the constitutionality of a alleged statutory trial de novo of a -- an administrative agency's decision, have found it necessary to amend judicially that the term trial de novo to mean simply that they're going to make a complete inquiry into the facts but they will not substitute their judgment to that of the agency since that they feel Turner: That is correct sir. \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: And didn't that letter suggest that the provision provide for a trial de novo? \nDonald F. Turner: Let me -- the sequence was this. Trial de novo, it was used in one letter by the Attorney General, a letter I believe dated September 24. The phrase review de novo appeared in the proposed draft of a statutory provision laying down standards applicable to bank mergers -- \nWilliam J use the phrase review de novo. It used the word trial de novo. And I must say having read the case that I failed to see how it supports the position of the appellees argue that it does, to me it's manifest from reading the opinion that the court is using the words trial and review de novo interchangeably. The statute as I said uses the word trial de novo, courts to review and will set aside the determination, it found to be unwarranted by: As this Court stated in the Keller case, trial de novo in that instance is acceptable so long as the first court -- \nHugo L. Black: What does it mean? \nEugene J. Metzger: It means, as we indicated earlier, that a complete new trial of the facts and the law. \nHugo L. Black: But just as though there had been no trial below. \nEugene J. Metzger: has been variously interpreted because of its constitutional difficulties, initially to hold a trial without reference to the decision below but a number of courts in order to preserve -- \nHugo L.

"What was the primary purpose of the Bank Merger Act according to Donald F. Turner?": " \nDonald F. Turner: There was or thought to be -- there was -- or there was or thought to be by the Congress a difference in approach. And I must say I don't suppose anybody really disputes that proposition. And what we are suggesting is that the purpose of the Bank Merger Act was to -- as best as you can, eliminate that difference. And my argument is that you don't eliminate it by applying -- by putting the courts in the position of applying a review standard. appropriate way of dealing with this matter was the, why do we think the Bank Merger Act finally did deal with it? \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, under the Government's view, how much weight is given to proposal? \nDonald F. Turner: To the determination Mr. Justice as such, it seems to me none. To expertise on particular issues, I don't think there's any single answer to that. That is in urging of this Act does not give the point fit in the purpose of the bill -- title of the bill. \nFrederic L. Ballard, Jr.: Yes Your Honor it is an extremely important point. The only -- \nHugo L. Black: They said, to establish a procedure for the review of the old bank merger so as to eliminate the necessity or the dissolution of merged banks and for the public. \nFrederic L.

"What concern did David T. Searls express regarding the burden of proof?": ": That does not necessarily follow and this Court has held that it does not necessarily follow. But the Court here was not reaching the burden of proof. That would not more properly come before a trial judge in a pretrial hearing or on the trial of the case. \nAbe Fortas: Well, Mr. Searls, what do you do at the first paragraph on 3 (A) of your brief, the court remarks? \nDavid T. Searls: I am ought to much concerned about the burden of proof but is what is actually necessary for you to allege?\" I think the trial court only determined the question of pleading, what was necessary to allege. But he analyzed the authorities to hold that the burden was on the plaintiff to allege and prove. \nEarl Warren: And if they had amended, he would've required them the proof? \nDavid T. Searls: I think he would because I think Your Honor the burden of proof is on the Government is that they agree that you've got to weigh it and balance, they claim that it's your burden of proof? \nDavid T. Searls: They claim it's a defensive matter. \nHugo L. Black: Yes, they claim it. \nDavid T. Searls: Yes, and I'm going to get to that Your Honor. \nHugo L.

Searls: Well certainly -- ordinarily, the burden of proof follows the burden of pleading, I agree with that. \nEarl Warren: Yes. \nDavid T. Searls: That does not necessarily follow and this Court has held that it does not necessarily follow. But the the burden of proof is on the Government to allege and prove not only the necessary anticompetitive consequences but also the -- a negative proposition that these are not out -- not clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community. \nPotter Stewart: Mr. Turner -- \nDonald F. Turner: But whether on the other hand, that is a matter to be -- to be raised by defendants with the burden lying on them. Yes Mr. Justice? \nPotter Stewart: and we have setout in our -- in the appendix to our brief, a colloquy between the court and the counsel for the Department of Justice. The Court said, \"Well, the burden, I am not too much concerned about the burden of proof, but as to what is actually necessary for you to allege. That is what we are concerned about here.\" The court rather said, \"I recognized full will that this is very important and serious litigation. And I have no more desire than.

"What was the position of the Department of Justice in the trial courts on the standards to be applied to bank mergers?": " Now, Your Honor I want to submit that the position taken by the Department of Justice before Your Honors is entirely different from the position taken in these six cases in the trial court. The Department of Justice has taken a consistent position in the trial court that Section 7 governs Bank Merger Act by the bank mergers even since the Bank Merger Act of 1966. I think it is clear from the position that they're taking in the trial courts, they were seeking to have a determination such as was the Department of Justice seems to be predicated upon the equation of competition in convenience and needs, for although the Department has conceded in argument that it considers and has always agreed in the courts below that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 has resulted in different standards or that it has accepted the standards of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, there is a serious question as to what they mean by the standards of BMA 66. For example in the Crocker-Anglo case in California, subsequent to bank agencies were applying in approving or disapproving mergers were quite dissimilar from those that had been applied by the courts. To be specific, I'm sure it was felt. Indeed, I think it was suggested at more than one point that the banking agencies were not applying the standard of Philadelphia National Bank. And what Congress wanted to do is to make sure as best as it could, that at east they started out trying to apply the same standards. And what I'm saying is you can't for rebuttal on this case. \nEarl Warren: Mr. Searls. \nDavid T. Searls: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. There have been six decisions rendered ever since the passage of the merger -- Bank Merger Act of 1966 by the trial courts, the federal trial courts. Each of those six decisions is contrary to an adverse to the Government in this case. In each of those six cases, the trial judge held that the Bank Merger to bank mergers. It has not been replaced or repealed by the Bank Merger Act of 1966, and the plaintiff is not required to plead or prove a violation of the Bank Merger Act. Now, the point Mr. Justice Fortas' raised before is particularly relevant to the reasons why the Department of Justice has taken this position. It was not an act of casual intransigence upon the part of Justice below that it only alleged a violation of Clayton 7, nor is it an act that the Department of Justice and the courts had to follow the same test and the same standards that the Comptroller was required to follow. This Court recognized that fact to be true and said that the Bank Merger Act of 1960 did not change the substantive test to be applied in a suit claiming a violation of antitrust laws. That was one of the main reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee court should consider also that mergers and the approval of mergers that its only one function of a banking agency. It must effectuate a national banking policy particularly the Comptroller of the Currency who has charged the chartering, branching, and merging in the National Banking System and that the mergers are but a small part of -- for example the United States last year, there are 35 more bank charters than there were mergers. In the entire years of 1965, only one merger was attacked by's suit must be predicated upon and taken from the Bank Merger Act of 1966. If that is so, the internal logic of that statute requires with us to considerate as a review of the statute and a review standard the Justice must apply. It was for this reason that the court below suggested that the -- the Justice below suggested that Clayton 7 still applied. They needed an independent statute to get them into court. They needed to say, \"We don't need the Bank Merger Act of",

"How did the California three-judge court rule regarding the Department of Justice's interpretation of the Bank Merger Act?": " in this case. In each of those six cases, the trial judge held that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 was the controlling statute. One of those six decisions is a three-judge court by -- in the Northern District of California, one Circuit Judge and two District Judges sitting. In the present case, the suit is brought under Section 7 of the Clayton Act. And the trial court passed strictly on pleading a question because the only issue before the court was on a motion to dismiss. And for rebuttal on this case. \nEarl Warren: Mr. Searls. \nDavid T. Searls: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. There have been six decisions rendered ever since the passage of the merger -- Bank Merger Act of 1966 by the trial courts, the federal trial courts. Each of those six decisions is contrary to an adverse to the Government in this case. In each of those six cases, the trial judge held that the Bank Merger Now, Your Honor I want to submit that the position taken by the Department of Justice before Your Honors is entirely different from the position taken in these six cases in the trial court. The Department of Justice has taken a consistent position in the trial court that Section 7 governs Bank Merger Act by the bank mergers even since the Bank Merger Act of 1966. I think it is clear from the position that they're taking in the trial courts, they were seeking to have a determination such as wasEarl Warren: United States, Appellant, versus First City National Bank of Houston. Mr. Turner you may continue your argument. \nDonald F. Turner: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. Very briefly, we have before us two cases involving bank mergers and dismissal of complaints brought by the Government involving interpretation of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and more particularly the following provisions. The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger's suit must be predicated upon and taken from the Bank Merger Act of 1966. If that is so, the internal logic of that statute requires with us to considerate as a review of the statute and a review standard the Justice must apply. It was for this reason that the court below suggested that the -- the Justice below suggested that Clayton 7 still applied. They needed an independent statute to get them into court. They needed to say, \"We don't need the Bank Merger Act of the Department of Justice seems to be predicated upon the equation of competition in convenience and needs, for although the Department has conceded in argument that it considers and has always agreed in the courts below that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 has resulted in different standards or that it has accepted the standards of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, there is a serious question as to what they mean by the standards of BMA 66. For example in the Crocker-Anglo case in California, subsequent to said it is the Government's view that the new statute made no substantial change in the law or standards to be applied in passing up on the issues here presented. The Government puts it does then, it quotes the Government's position. It is of course the essential position of the Government that the 1966 amendment to the Bank Merger Act has not resulted in substantial change in substantive antitrust law or in the standards used by the courts in determining the legality of bank mergers. But then the three-judge to bank mergers. It has not been replaced or repealed by the Bank Merger Act of 1966, and the plaintiff is not required to plead or prove a violation of the Bank Merger Act. Now, the point Mr. Justice Fortas' raised before is particularly relevant to the reasons why the Department of Justice has taken this position. It was not an act of casual intransigence upon the part of Justice below that it only alleged a violation of Clayton 7, nor is it an act"}
