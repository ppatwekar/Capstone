    "What is the main argument presented by Mr. Mitchell regarding Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment?": "Jonathan F. Mitchell:  So in just as a matter of first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much harder argument for us to make because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has been treated as self-executing. What we would argue in the hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3 that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes to I Section 3. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  That's right. \nSonia Sotomayor:  So history proves a lot to me -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Mm-hmm. \nSonia Sotomayor:  -- and to my colleagues generally. There's a whole lot of examples of states relying on Section 3 to disqualify insurrectionists for state offices, and you're basically telling us that you want us to go two steps Court's questions. \nClarence Thomas:  Mr. Mitchell, would you -- you didn't spend much time on your argument with respect to whether or not Section 3 is self-executing, so would you address that?  And  -- and in doing that, your argument is that it's not self-executing, but then, in that case, what would the role of the State be, or is it entirely up to Congress to implement the disqualification in Section 3 powers from the states? Number two, Section 3 itself gives Congress a very definite role, which Mr. Mitchell says is interfered with by the ability of states to take somebody off the ballot?  And maybe, number three, it's just more complicated and more contested, and, if you want, more political?  And why don't all of those things make a difference in our thinking about this qualification as opposed to any other? \nShannon W. Stevenson:  And so, Your of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment is?  It's by the Chief Justice of the United States a year after the Fourteenth Amendment. That seems to me -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yes. \nBrett M. Kavanaugh:  -- highly probative of what the meaning or understanding of that language, otherwise elusive language, is. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  I do think it's probative, Justice Kavanaugh. We didn't rely too heavily on the like and interpret it tangentially because the other side can come back with us and throw this countervailing evidence back in our face. So we wanted to focus more on the text of the Constitution because this was ultimately a compromise provision that was enacted in Section 3, and -- \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Let me ask you another question -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Mm-hmm. \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  -- Mitchell:  Mm-hmm. \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  -- about the states because you have forcefully made an argument about the states not being able to enforce Section 3. So, if we agree with you on that, what happens next?  I mean, I thought you also wanted us to end the litigation. So is there a possibility that this case continues in federal court if that's our conclusion? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  I don't see and this is his words -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Mm-hmm. \nSonia Sotomayor:  -- Section 3 as executing itself, needing no legislation o n the part of Congress to give it effect. So you're relying on a non-precedential case by a justice who later takes back what he said. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  But the key point with Griffin's Case and why it's an important precedent, despite everything",

    "How does Mr. Mitchell interpret the term 'officer of the United States' in the Constitution?": " whatnot. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Perhaps, but there are al so implications from other parts of the Constitution which really help us on the \"officer of the United States\" argument in that second part of Section 3 but somewhat cut against us when it comes to \"office under the United States.\" And the Anderson litigants point this out in Footnote 9 in the red brief where they say, if this Court were to say the presidency is an excluded office under the United States argument is that the president is not an officer of the United States, correct? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yeah, I would say it a little more forcefully than what Your Honor just described. We believe the presidency is excluded from \"office under the United States,\" but the argument we have that he's excluded, the president, as an officer of the United States is the stronger of the two textually. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Ah. \nJonathan F \"officers of the United States\" is a term of art that doesn't refer just to federal officeholders, which is what the Anderson litigants are cl aiming, but refers only to those who are appointed, not to those who are elected. \nNeil Gorsuch:  Thank you. \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh? \nBrett M. Kavanaugh:  Can I just make sure I understand how you're using Griffin's Case again? Section 3 focus on the second, and we acknowledge that we have a somewhat heavier lift on the first point just because -- \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  Why?  It seems to me that you have a list and president is not on it. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  That -- that's certainly an argument in our favor, but there are also  -- with respect to \"officer of the United States,\" that's used repeatedly in the Constitution and the Commissions Clause and the Speaker and the President Pro Tempore in the line of succession. They are officers. But they're not officers of the United States because they're not subject to impeachment, they're not commissioned by the president, and they're not appointed pursuant to Article II. So there is this gap between the term \"officer\" and the phrase \"officers of the United States,\" reinforcing the idea that \"officers of the United States\" is a term of art that doesn't refer just to federal of their own citizens. \nElena Kagan:  Thank you. \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch? \nNeil Gorsuch:  You haven't had a chance to talk about the officer point, and I just want to give you an opportunity to do that. Mr. Mitchell makes the argument that particularly in the Commissions Clause, for example, all officers are to be commissioned by the president, seems to be all-encompassing, that language.'s why we're leaning more on the \"officer of\" argument than the \"office under.\" We're not conceding \"office under,\" but we definitely have the stronger textual case and structural case on \"officer of the United States.\" \nElena Kagan:  Thank you. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Thanks. \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch? \nNeil Gorsuch:  Do you want to respond to some of the specific textual says they can't. So maybe the Constitution to us today, to a lay reader, might look a little odd in distinguishing between \"office\" and \"officer,\" not prepositions, nouns, a distinction. But maybe that's exactly how it works. Thoughts? \nJason C. Murray:  Well, I'd start with the idea that the meaning of \"officer\" in the 1780s was the same meaning that it has today, which is a person who holds",

    "Why does Mr. Mitchell believe the Colorado Supreme Court's decision should be reversed?": "John G. Roberts, Jr.: We'll hear argument this morning in Case 23-719, Trump versus Anderson. Mr. Mitchell. \nJonathan F. Mitchell: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Colorado Supreme Court held that President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons. The first reason is that President Trump is not F. Mitchell:  That's correct. \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Final question. The Colorado Supreme Court concluded that the violent attempts of the Petitioner's supporters in this case to halt the count on January 6th qualified as an insurrection as defined by Section 3. And I read your opening brief to accept that those events counted as an insurrection, but then your reply seemed to suggest that they were not. So what is your position as to that? \n  I was just going to add one last thing. I think your argument's a little broader than that because I think, if we accept your position that disqualifying someone from the ballot is adding a qualification, really, your position is that Congress can't enact a statute that would allow Colorado to do what it's done either because then Congress would be adding a qualification, which it can't do either. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  No, I don't agree with that, Justice Barrett might be due process issues. But we didn't develop that argument in this Court for several issues. Winning on due process doesn't really do as much for our client as the other arguments that we've made because that would be a ruling specific to this particular proceeding in the State of Colorado and would leave the door open for Colorado to continue on remand to exclude him from the b allot. \nAmy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Thank you. \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.: it not lead to that consequence? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  I don't think so because Colorado law does not recognize non-mutual collateral estoppel. And I believe the preclusive effect of the decision would be determined by Colorado law rather than the law of another state. But I think your question, Justice Alito, gives rise to an even greater concern because, if this decision does not have preclusive effect in other lawsuits, it opens the possibility that a different factual record. Would it not permit  -- would it not lead to the possibility that other states would say, using their choice -of -law rules and their rules on  -- on collateral estoppel, that there's non-mutual collateral estoppel against former President Trump and so the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court could effectively decide this question for many other states, perhaps all other states? Could it not lead to that consequence? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  I don't think soJonathan F. Mitchell:  So in just as a matter of first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much harder argument for us to make because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has been treated as self-executing. What we would argue in the hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3 that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes to I  What the court  -- the Colorado Supreme Court did  -- and let me, if I could have a standing objection, I do want to make the argument that you shouldn't  review the Court's statutory interpretation. \nClarence Thomas:  No, I'm just looking at the statute. \nShannon W. Stevenson:  Right. What the Court did was to say that we have three important provisions in this section that show that candidates have to be qualified. First,",

    "What example does Mr. Mitchell give to argue that states cannot impose additional qualifications for federal office?": " powers from the states? Number two, Section 3 itself gives Congress a very definite role, which Mr. Mitchell says is interfered with by the ability of states to take somebody off the ballot?  And maybe, number three, it's just more complicated and more contested, and, if you want, more political?  And why don't all of those things make a difference in our thinking about this qualification as opposed to any other? \nShannon W. Stevenson:  And so, Your Qualifications Clause, right?  Nobody's talking about whether he's 35 years old or a natural born, whatever, right, not at issue, okay. We're talking about something under the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 3, so that's where you have to find your authority, right? \nJason C. Murray:  We find our authority in Article II in state's plenary power to run their elections. \nNeil Gorsuch:  Federal election  --but this is for a constitutional qualification rather than enforcing a new state-imposed qualification. And that's the key under Term Limits. Is the state  in any way altering the criteria for a federal office, either for Congress or for the presidency?  And in this situation, the Colorado Supreme Court is going slightly beyond what Section 3 requires because Section 3 on its face bans an insurrectionist only from holding office. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, can I stop you a moment and  -- and back be of age if elected. We have a history of at least one state disqualifying someone who wasn't a U.S. citizen. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Right. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Is -- are your arguments limited to Section 3? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Not quite. The question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the state is violating Term Limits by adding to or altering the extant qualifications for the presidency in the ConstitutionJonathan F. Mitchell:  You're changing -- \nSonia Sotomayor:  I'm just confused. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Okay. With respect to the -- maybe I'll start with the age example. \nSonia Sotomayor:  Mm-hmm. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  If a state like Colorado says you can't appear on our presidential ballot unless you are 35 years old on the day of the election,  I was just going to add one last thing. I think your argument's a little broader than that because I think, if we accept your position that disqualifying someone from the ballot is adding a qualification, really, your position is that Congress can't enact a statute that would allow Colorado to do what it's done either because then Congress would be adding a qualification, which it can't do either. \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  No, I don't agree with that, Justice Barrett -- to explain the overall structure of -- of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nJason C. Murray:  We certainly have a long history in this country of states using their power to determine the manner of selecting presidential electors to enforce other qualifications in the Constitution. I don't  -- I don't take it there's a great debate about whether or not states are allowed to exclude underaged or foreign-born candidates or, if President Bush or Obama wanted to run for a third term, that they:  All right. But just circle back to where we started, right?  This is Section 3. Your authority has to come from there. And it's about holding office and it's a particular kind of disability that can be removed by Congress and it's the only one like that, right?  They can't remove age or citizenship. How should that inform our thoughts about a state's efforts to regulate the ballot for a federal office? \nJason C. Murray:  The coll",

But, as -- \nSonia Sotomayor:  But -- but that has nothing to say with respect to what Section 3 means.

Mitchell:  Yes. \nKetanji Brown Jackson:  -- can I ask you to address your first argument, which is the office/officer point? \nElena Kagan:  Could  --could --Jonathan F. Mitchell:  So in just as a matter of first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much harder argument for us to make because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has been treated as self-executing. What we would argue in the hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3 that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it goes to I that -- is that what you're doing here?  You're not saying that the Constitution gives you this rule. It's the kind of combination of Griffin's Case plus the way Congress acted after Griffin's Case  -- \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yes. \nElena Kagan:  -- that gives you the rule? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  That's exactly right, Justice Kagan, because we have implementing legislation, Congress took up the invitation provided by Griffin\nSonia Sotomayor:  So a non-precedential decision that relies on policy doesn't look at the language, doesn't look at the history, doesn't analyze anything than the disruption that such a suit would bring, you want us to credit as precedential? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Because Congress relied on Griffin's Case when it enacted the Enforcement Act of 1870 and established the -- \nElena Kagan:  So, Mr. Mitchell, if initially had in the 1870 -- \nElena Kagan:  Is that your position? \nJonathan F. Mitchell:  Yes, because we believe Griffin's Case is correctly decided and should be followed  -- \nElena Kagan:  And how does that fit with -- a lot of the  -- the --the answers to the questions that we've been giving, you said, well, Congress has to have the ability by a two-thirds vote to lift the disqualification Court's questions. \nClarence Thomas:  Mr. Mitchell, would you -- you didn't spend much time on your argument with respect to whether or not Section 3 is self-executing, so would you address that?  And  -- and in doing that, your argument is that it's not self-executing, but then, in that case, what would the role of the State be, or is it entirely up to Congress to implement the disqualification in Section 3"
